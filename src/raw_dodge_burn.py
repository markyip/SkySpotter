"""
Dodge & burn: local exposure brush with edge-aware mask snapping.

Design:
    - The mask is a single-channel float32 array at the edit base's working
      resolution (half-res live-preview base or full-res export base),
      range roughly [-1.5, +1.5]: positive = dodge (brighten), negative =
      burn (darken), accumulated additively per stroke and clipped.
    - Painting stamps a soft (gaussian-falloff) circular brush at the
      cursor position, scaled by trackpad/tablet pressure, directly into
      the mask -- cheap, O(brush area) per point, not O(image).
    - On stroke release the touched region is edge-snapped: a guided
      filter (existing raw_chroma_denoise.apply_guided_filter, reused
      as-is) using the base image's luminance as the guide pulls the
      mask's soft edges onto real image edges (a hand-painted circle over
      a sky/foreground boundary ends up following the boundary, not the
      brush's geometric edge). This is the "edge-assisted selection".
    - Applied as a per-pixel exposure multiplier: 2**(mask * stops), where
      stops (typically 1.5-2.0) is the panel's Dodge/Burn Strength slider
      -- consistent with how Exposure2012 is applied elsewhere in the
      scene-linear pipeline (raw_edit_pipeline.process_linear_edit_buffer).
    - Persisted in the XMP sidecar as a base64 PNG blob (see
      serialize_mask/deserialize_mask) -- there is no Lightroom-compatible
      local-adjustment schema to target, so this is a SkySpotter-private
      custom element, additive to the existing crs: attributes.
