"""
Fast full-resolution RAW decode with exact LibRaw color parity.

Replaces ``rawpy.postprocess()`` for the sensor-resolution zoom decode only
(export and the Adjust-panel edit base keep their existing rawpy paths).
LibRaw still does the unpack (file decode); this module reimplements the
*pixel math* with cv2/numpy primitives that are SIMD + multithreaded.
Honest end-to-end numbers (fresh imread each run, min of 3, Apple M1):
1.4-1.7x faster than rawpy's LINEAR demosaic path (what the sensor decode
used before) and 2.3-3.1x faster than AHD — with *better* demosaic quality
than LINEAR (cv2 edge-aware vs bilinear). LibRaw unpack (100-400ms,
CPU-bound, not offloadable) is the Amdahl floor on further gains. GPU offload (OpenCL/Metal) was measured and
rejected: cv2's CPU demosaic is already memory-bound on unified memory
(19ms GPU vs 17ms CPU for a 33MP frame), so a GPU backend adds dependency
weight for no gain. See docs/local/UPCOMING_FEATURES.md section E.

Color parity (the E2 gate that blocked the earlier GPU PoC) is exact by
construction — every step below replicates dcraw/LibRaw semantics for the
app's decode params (use_camera_wb, no_auto_bright, output_bps=8,
gamma=(2.222, 4.5), user_flip=0, highlight_mode=clip):

1. Per-channel black subtraction and white-balance scaling exactly as
   dcraw ``scale_colors``: camera multipliers divided by their *minimum*
   (all >= 1) and the result clipped to 65535 in camera space *before* the
   color matrix — this is what forces clipped highlights to saturate to
   neutral white. (The earlier PoC normalized by max and clipped after the
   matrix, which is exactly what produced its shifted highlight colors.)
2. ``rgb_cam`` derived exactly as dcraw ``cam_xyz_coeff``: forward matrix
   ``cam_rgb = cam_xyz @ XYZ_RGB`` row-normalized (rows sum to 1, mapping
   camera white to sRGB white) then pseudo-inverted. ``raw.color_matrix``
   cannot be used directly — LibRaw leaves it zeroed for most cameras
   (verified on Sony ARW and Canon CR3).
3. LibRaw ``adjust_maximum`` (default adjust_maximum_thr=0.75) replicated
   for the effective saturation level.
4. Output gamma is dcraw's BT.709 curve for gamma=(2.222, 4.5) — linear toe
   below the solved breakpoint, ``(1+g4)*x^(1/2.222) - g4`` above — with the
   8-bit output taken as ``curve >> 8`` like dcraw's write_ppm.

Verified: the demosaic-free half-size reference path below matches
``rawpy.postprocess(half_size=True, ...)`` within +/-1 8-bit LSB on 100% of
pixels across Sony ARW + 12 Canon CR3 golden files (run
``scripts/fast_raw_decode_parity_gate.py``). Highlights included.

Scope guards: Bayer 2x2 / 3-color / uint16 sensors only — X-Trans, Foveon,
monochrome, linear DNG, float DNG and 4-color CFAs all return None and fall
back to the existing rawpy path. Disable entirely with
``RAWVIEWER_FAST_RAW_DECODE=0``.

    LibRaw splits black into a base (``color.black``) plus per-channel deltas
    (``color.cblack[0..3]``), and rawpy's ``black_level_per_channel`` exposes
    only the deltas. On bodies LibRaw parses fully the deltas carry the whole
    level (EOS R5: [512]*4) and this returns them untouched. On a body whose
    makernote layout the bundled LibRaw predates, the base holds the level and
    the deltas come back as small ISO trims over a ZERO floor -- the EOS R6
    Mark III reports [0, 33, 100, 67] against a true black of 2049. Subtracting
    only those leaves a ~2048/16383 = 12%-of-range pedestal in every channel,
    which the WB multipliers then amplify unequally into a heavy color cast:
    the "new camera color shift". (rawpy's own postprocess renders these files
    with the same pedestal, so it is no use as a reference here -- the camera's
    embedded JPEG is, and the repaired black is what matches it.)

    ``cblack.min() <= 0`` is the signature of the missing base: a real sensor
    floor is never zero. Only then do we measure the sensor's masked
    optical-black columns, which are the physical zero reference, and use that
    flat level for all four channels (measured per CFA phase, the R6 III's
    phases agree to 1 LSB -- LibRaw's lopsided deltas are NOT a per-channel
    floor and must not be added on top).

    The measurement is deliberately gated rather than universal: on a Sony ARW
    in the sample set the left margin reads 884 against a true black of 512, so
    it is not clean masked black on every body. Bodies LibRaw already gets right

    ``prefer_gpu`` defaults to False: measured no speed benefit from the MPS
    path on real files (45-46MP CR3/NEF, ~358-365ms either way, GPU
    occasionally slower after warmup) -- consistent with this module's own
    top-of-file docstring, which already concluded the same for the earlier
    OpenCL/Metal PoC ("19ms GPU vs 17ms CPU... adds dependency weight for no
    gain"). GPU decode also feeds the MPS unified-memory pressure that
    needed a dedicated release_cached_gpu_memory() mitigation elsewhere
    (image_cache.py) -- avoiding it by default when it buys nothing removes
    that cost too. Set True explicitly for a caller that specifically wants
    to exercise the GPU path (e.g. stashed full-tier zoom when
    ``prefer_gpu_decode_enabled()``, or a parity/benchmark script).
