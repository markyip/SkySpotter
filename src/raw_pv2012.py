# genuine near-zero denominator can't blow up unbounded. Replaces the old

# 8x = 3 stops of shadow lift, 0.25x = 2 stops of crush. Modern sensors
# hold recoverable detail well past 3 stops under (Exposure, applied
# scene-linear upstream, is uncapped and proves it); the old 3.0 cap
# (~1.6 stops) made Shadows/Blacks top out far below what the file
# contains.
#
# A first pass raised this to 16x (4 stops) and relied on the chroma damp
# below to control noise. In practice, real per-pixel sensor chroma noise
# (the blue channel especially -- lowest QE/highest relative read noise
# on most Bayer sensors) gets amplified by the SAME ratio as genuine
# shadow detail: a real photo test measured a synthetic 0.0004 scene-
# linear blue-channel noise std turning into a display-space blue-vs-green
# channel deviation of std ~3.0 (about 4x the luminance grain) at 16x,
# visible as colored speckle in dark clothing/hair -- reported as "blue
# color artifact" with less perceived detail (the speckle masks it). 8x
# roughly halves the worst-case amplification while still recovering far
# more than the original 3.0 cap; the strengthened chroma damp below
# (raised from 0.35 to 0.85 max) does most of the remaining noise control.
#
# NOTE (post return_linear fix): fixing decode_half_from_unpacked's
# ignored return_linear flag (fast_raw_decode.py) means y0 here is now
# genuinely scene-linear instead of gamma-encoded data mislabeled as
# linear -- true deep-shadow y0 on a real CR3 runs as low as ~0.0006 in
# the darkest 5%, which saturates this 8x cap across nearly the entire
# Shadows 50-100 slider range (measured: Shadows=50 and Shadows=100
# produce identical output there) and likely contributes to a recurring
# "grey casting" report. Tried raising back to 16x post-fix: t_tone_engine
# regressed (chroma speckle test failed, b-g std 0.87 > luma std 0.43),
# so the cap is not the right knob to turn -- a naive increase reproduces
# the exact speckle regression 8x was chosen to fix, just via the
# now-corrected data scale instead of the old buggy one. Left at 8x;
# the anchor band and lift_frac saturation point (both below) were also
# tuned against the same buggy data and need their own recalibration
