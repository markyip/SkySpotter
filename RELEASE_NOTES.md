# RAWviewer Release Notes

## 🚧 Unreleased (SkySpotter main)

🧹 Project housekeeping
- Removed unused CoreML helper scripts: `scripts/download_mobileclip_coreml.py` and `scripts/export_mobileclip2_coreml.py`.
- Removed legacy aircraft ONNX artifacts: `src/models/super_specialist.onnx` and `src/models/super_specialist_quantized.onnx`.
- Cleaned generated PoC output folders from repository working tree.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude local PoC outputs and local cache/index artifacts.

📘 Documentation updates
- README now documents the recommended pixi workflow (`pixi install`, `pixi run start`).
- README classifier section updated to prioritize `aviation_model_processed/` checkpoint flow.
- README now documents checkpoint-only aircraft inference behavior (no ONNX fallback).
- Added `pixi run batch-test-classifier` (`scripts/batch_test_classifier.py`); training auto-runs background removal; default checkpoint folder `customized_model/`.

## 🚀 Version 2.0.1
**Release Date: May 23, 2026**

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **Google Pixel DNG Support**: Fixed critical crashes in the `QImageReader` and `EXIFExtractor` fallbacks that prevented Google Pixel DNG files from rendering on macOS.
- **Gallery Aspect Ratio Fix**: Fixed a bug where thumbnail crops were improperly bypassed, ensuring that all gallery tiles now correctly display cropped square previews without distorted aspect ratios or zoomed-in glitches.

## 🚀 Version 2.0.0
**Release Date: May 7, 2026**

🎯 What's New
- **Local Semantic Search**: Cross-platform natural-language gallery search. Harness the power of MobileCLIP (Core ML on macOS, ONNX on Windows) to rank images by meaning (e.g., "sunny landscape" or "vintage portrait").
- **Structured Metadata Filters**: Powerful new query syntax to narrow by `camera:`, `lens:`, `iso:`, `ext:`, and more.
- **Slideshow Mode**: Automatic hands-free playback of your photos with adjustable intervals.
- **macOS Native Share**: Integration with the native macOS share sheet for instant sending via Mail, AirDrop, or Messages.
- **High-Fidelity Rendering**: New LANCZOS resampling and 2x JPEG oversampling for razor-sharp display on 4K and Retina screens.
- **Native macOS & Windows Shell Integration**: Improved Windows shell verbs and deep Finder/Explorer compatibility.
- **Non-Destructive Rotation**: Instantly rotate any image (including RAW) by 90° steps visually without modifying the original file.
- **Massive Location Intelligence**: Added ~150+ world cities to the GPS contradiction filter and improved multi-word place detection (e.g., "Hong Kong").
- **Precision Focus Overlays**: Added focus point visualization using MakerNote data for Canon, Nikon, and Sony.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **High-Quality RAW Fallback**: Automatically triggers high-quality "fast RAW decode" for files with poor-quality embedded previews.
- **Performance Hardening**: Refactored `UnifiedImageProcessor` to open RAW files exactly once, drastically reducing Disk I/O.

### ⌨️ Keyboard & Gesture Map
- **Space / Double-click**: Toggle between "Fit to Window" and 100% zoom.
