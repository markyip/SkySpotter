# SkySpotter Release Notes

## Unreleased (main)

Work in progress on the **SkySpotter** aviation specialist viewer—not yet tagged as a release.

### Merged from RAWviewer v2.2 (upstream)

**Release Date: May 30, 2026**

Unified 2.2 release updates integrated into SkySpotter:
- **Search from single-image view**: Search button in single view; submitting a query switches to gallery with filtered results.
- **Fast single-file open**: Opening one image no longer waits for full folder scan and EXIF sort on large libraries.
- **Windows — Open with another app**: Native picker via `OpenAs_RunDLLW` / `SHOpenWithDialog` with `OAIF_EXEC` for Lightroom, Photoshop, etc., directly exposed in the bottom bar via the Share button.
- **macOS — Share (single image)**: Bottom-bar share in single view uses a **Qt menu** of `NSSharingService` targets (Mail, Messages, …).
- **Experimental GPU single-image view**: Opt in with `RAWVIEWER_GPU_VIEW=1` for smoother zoom/pan on supported hardware (classic scroll area remains the default).
- **Consistent RAW color (fit ↔ zoom)**: Single-image RAW defaults to LibRaw half-res for fit view and full decode at 100% zoom (`RAWVIEWER_LIBRAW_CONSISTENT_PREVIEW=1`), avoiding embedded-JPEG color snap. Gallery thumbnails still use fast embedded previews.
- **Unified EXIF dual-backend**: Metadata routes through `metadata_backend` — fast header reads for RAW, optional `pyexiv2` for JPEG/TIFF (`RAWVIEWER_EXIF_BACKEND=auto`).
- **Frameless window resize (Windows)**: Drag any window edge (including top strip and bottom-right grip) to resize.
- **Film strip & Search panel fixes**: Fixed phantom selection, recursion on hover, and sync to search-filtered lists. Collapsing the search field no longer shifts status-bar icons.

### Aircraft gallery & indexing

- All AI (ViT labels, indexing, Magic Wand) runs **locally**—photos are not sent to the cloud for detection.
- ViT aircraft classifier with gallery labels, Magic Wand auto-sort, and `aircraft:` / model-name gallery search (EXIF + detected labels).
- Gallery classifier version tracking: custom models protected from auto-update; official updates prompt with progress; aircraft labels re-index when weights change.
- Fixes for aircraft filter queries, Magic Wand moves when a type folder already exists, and reading indexed labels from the database.
- Minimum crop size for classification uses a fraction of the source image (default 20% per axis) instead of a fixed pixel floor.
- Faster open when launching on a single file: show that image first while the rest of the folder scans in the background.
- **Search → gallery navigation**: Clicking a search result opens the correct image; film strip and arrow keys stay within filtered results.
- **Gallery refresh after EXIF sort**: Gallery auto-updates when background capture-time refinement completes.
- **Gallery thumbnails**: Click handler uses the widget’s current path so reordered/filtered grids navigate correctly.
- **Search panel UI**: Collapsing the search field no longer shifts nearby status-bar icons; fixed width jump when clearing the query.
- **Search indexing UX**: No flash of stale progress after search completes; session-aware index status.
- **Semantic indexing**: Skip duplicate RAW companion files when writing to the index; resolved progress bar resets by scaling progress between thumbnail warming (10%) and neural pass (90%).

### Blur detection — sharp / blurry gallery filters (experimental, **disabled by default**)

> **Experimental — reference only.** Not enabled in the default app build. Laplacian + subject-rect scoring did not match visual culling well enough in our tests. Enable with `SkySpotter_ENABLE_BLUR_SCORE=1` and re-index; see README **Experimental features**.

- **`sharp` / `blurry` search tokens** (when enabled) use indexed `blur_score` on a **`subject_rect`** crop of original RGB (rembg bbox).
- **Folder-relative ranking:** lowest fraction = blurry (default **20%**, `SkySpotter_BLUR_BLURRY_FRACTION`).
- **POC:** `scripts/poc_blur_detect.py` (requires `pixi run fix-opencv` for rembg).

**Performance & image pipeline**
- **Butter-smooth gallery scroll**: Faster scroll-speed detection and throttled prefetch during fast scrolling.
- **Fast-open / EXIF refinement**: Parallel capture-time probing, gated gallery EXIF sort, viewport scroll anchor on manual sort, instant gallery button when sort cache is warm.
- **GPU navigation**: Smoother gallery→single transitions and priority full-resolution decodes; 27% zoom race fix.
- **CPU downscaling**: Replaced LANCZOS with HAMMING for thumbnail downscales (faster, cleaner edges on CPU).
- **GPU viewport scaling**: Experimental GPU view uses hardware-accelerated scaling where enabled.
- **GPU single-view navigation**: Arrow keys and film strip keep the previous frame visible until the next buffer is ready; prefetched preview/full caches paint immediately; thumbnail-only stages are skipped during in-folder navigation to reduce flicker.
- **GPU fit ↔ 100% zoom**: Space and double-click now reach true 100% on the first action on RAW (fixes stale fit-mode flag showing ~fit% until a second toggle); resolution upgrades no longer undo an active 100% zoom.
- **Resolution crossfade (optional)**: Smoother preview→full upgrades in single view (`RAWVIEWER_RESOLUTION_CROSSFADE_MS`, default 280; set `RAWVIEWER_DISABLE_CROSSFADE=1` to disable).
- **Idle display prefetch**: Neighbor images warm preview/full buffers while browsing (`RAWVIEWER_IDLE_DISPLAY_PREFETCH`, `RAWVIEWER_NAV_PRELOAD_*`).
- **Multi-core RAW postprocess**: Process pool for LibRaw when `RAWVIEWER_USE_PROCESS_POOL=1` (default on 4+ cores).
- **Progressive RAW load**: Optional embedded-first path via `RAWVIEWER_PROGRESSIVE_RAW_LOAD=1` (off by default).

**Platform & docs**
- **macOS share under Qt6**: Default dev/shipping path uses Qt menu + `performWithItems_`; picker fallback and AirDrop/Finder behavior documented in `docs/macos-sharing-v21-v22.md`.
- **Folder sort**: Production uses EXIF / probe / birth / mtime only; Windows Shell `DateTaken` POC removed.
- **`clear_cache.bat` / `clear_cache.sh`**: Full dev/session reset.
- **Windows share helper** (sources retained): .NET `WindowsShareHelper.exe` for WinRT share in dev builds.
- **Environment**: `activation.env` with `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` to prevent global package leaks and splash issues.

### Models & installer

- Default checkpoint lives under `models/gallery-classifier/skyspotter-military-aircraft-vit/` (Git LFS); legacy `app_model/` path still supported.
- Windows installer: SkySpotter branding, `pixi.lock` + `pixi install --locked`, gallery classifier install step (`scripts/download_app_model.py`).
- Installer entry uses `src/bootstrap.py` (replaces missing legacy installer script).

### Documentation

- README rewritten for aviation workflows (focus overlay, aircraft search, formats, Pixi-only builds).
- SkySpotter release history will be listed here as versions ship.

## 🚀 Version 2.0.1
**Release Date: May 23, 2026**

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **Google Pixel DNG Support**: Fixed critical crashes in the `QImageReader` and `EXIFExtractor` fallbacks that prevented Google Pixel DNG files from rendering on macOS.
- **Gallery Aspect Ratio Fix**: Fixed a bug where thumbnail crops were improperly bypassed, ensuring that all gallery tiles now correctly display cropped square previews without distorted aspect ratios or zoomed-in glitches.
- **DNG Single-View Zoom Stability**: Reworked DNG single-image loading to use a full-resolution-first path and tightened pending zoom-state handling, fixing intermittent cases where Space / double-click changed zoom status text without actually zooming the image.
