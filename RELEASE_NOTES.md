# RAWviewer Release Notes

## 🚀 Version 2.1.0
**Release Date: May 28, 2026**

🎯 What's New
- **Bottom Film Strip (Single View)**: Added an overlay film strip with hot-zone reveal, shared thumbnail caching, and improved hover/dismiss behavior (including immediate hide when pointer leaves or enters the bottom menu area).
- **Semantic + Face Indexing Stability**: Semantic indexing now prioritizes search readiness, with face-count backfill running in a safer background pass and better progress reporting for large folders.
- **RAW Decode Resilience**: Improved fallback behavior for problematic RAW files during indexing and thumbnail paths to reduce repeated failures and avoid retry loops.
- **Installer Reliability & Size Hygiene**: Installer now rebuilds the Pixi environment cleanly and avoids carrying stale local logs into fresh installs.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **Google Pixel DNG Support**: Fixed critical crashes in the `QImageReader` and `EXIFExtractor` fallbacks that prevented Google Pixel DNG files from rendering on macOS.
- **Gallery Aspect Ratio Fix**: Fixed a bug where thumbnail crops were improperly bypassed, ensuring that all gallery tiles now correctly display cropped square previews without distorted aspect ratios or zoomed-in glitches.
- **DNG Single-View Zoom Stability**: Reworked DNG single-image loading to use a full-resolution-first path and tightened pending zoom-state handling, fixing intermittent cases where Space / double-click changed zoom status text without actually zooming the image.
- **Logging Path Unification**: Runtime logs/fatal dumps now target `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\RAWviewer\\logs` to prevent project-local log growth in packaged installs.
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Trimmed unused installer/runtime dependencies and restored required network dependency for Hugging Face model download flow.

**Release Date: May 7, 2026**

🎯 What's New

- **Slideshow Mode**: Automatic hands-free playback of your photos with adjustable intervals.
- **macOS Native Share**: Integration with the native macOS share sheet for instant sending via Mail, AirDrop, or Messages.

- **Precision Focus Overlays**: Added focus point visualization using MakerNote data for Canon, Nikon, and Sony.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **High-Quality RAW Fallback**: Automatically triggers high-quality "fast RAW decode" for files with poor-quality embedded previews.
