# SkySpotter Release Notes


## 🚀 Version 1.0.0
**Release Date: July 16, 2026**

SkySpotter **1.0** integrates upstream RAWviewer **3.0** into the aviation specialist viewer. It brings fully integrated **editing functions** and introduces a **new image loading logic** for incredible speed. We conducted multiple testing to check the speed improvement compared to version 2.5, confirming significant performance gains across various camera formats. 

It is built as a faster **browse / cull** release on top of 2.5: featuring **Fast RAW decode**, star ratings with XMP, Nikon HE/HE* handling, a shared **blue aviation** chrome theme (`theme.py`), and dozens of navigation / gallery reliability fixes.

### 🚀 Key Feature Highlights

#### ✈️ SkySpotter aviation backend
- Gallery **ViT aircraft classification** + `aircraft:` search labels (MobileCLIP free-text embeddings remain **off** by default).
- **Magic Wand** auto-sort into aircraft-type folders (`Unclassified/` for unlabeled).
- Feature flags: `config/skyspotter_features.json` (`semantic_search`, `face_scan`, `blur_score`).
- New flat **aviation app icon** (blue jet + spotter reticle).

#### 🎨 Full Editing Functions
> [!WARNING]
> **Disclaimer:** The editing feature is currently experimental. We cannot guarantee compatibility with all camera models, especially newly released models.
- The **Adjust / Develop editing panel** is now fully integrated and on by default for all users.
- Includes tone curve, lens correction, detail, chroma denoise, dodge/burn, and PV2012-style develops.
- Editing actions are non-destructive and save directly to **XMP** sidecars (`RAWVIEWER_SIDECAR_ADJUST=1` by default).
- **Auto WB**: Added automatic white balance estimation.
- **Hover-focusable sliders**: Adjust sliders now accept keyboard input (`+`/`-` or arrows) when hovered.
- **Export Progress with Cancel**: Modal dialog with progress bar and cancel support for baked exports.
- **Accurate Edited Previews**: Enhanced accuracy for edited previews and constrained sidecar saving to RAW-only.
- **Slider Paint Crash Fix**: Fixed a startup crash related to AdjustSlider hover-focus initialization.

#### ⚡ Updated Image Loading Logic & Verified Speed
- **Fast RAW decode** is on by default (`RAWVIEWER_FAST_RAW_DECODE=1`): half-size and full sensor tiers share one unpack; verified color parity with the previous pipeline (±1 8-bit LSB on golden ARW/CR3 sets).
- **EDR Support Removed:** macOS EDR (Extended Dynamic Range) support has been removed at this stage. The new, highly optimized image loading pipeline is not compatible with EDR, causing very slow image decoding and loading. To maintain high-speed browsing and editing performance, EDR has been disabled.
- **Multiple testing verified**: Extensive benchmarking against version 2.5 confirms massive speed improvements:
  - **Full sensor decode:** about **1.4×** faster (median); high-end formats in the **1.3–1.7×** range where Fast RAW applies.
  - **Zoom after fit** (reuse the fit-view unpack): roughly **2×** faster than a cold full rawpy decode.
  - **Half-size fit-view browsing:** about **1.2–1.3×** faster on typical ARW sets; throughput up around **+30%**.
- Cold gallery thumbnail warmup ~3× faster; Canon CR3 embedded previews no longer read the whole file; EXIF cache no longer serializes every reader through one global lock (multi-second nav stalls fixed).
- Heavy optional ML imports deferred until after first paint (~0.9s less startup freeze).
- Neighbor embedded-JPEG prefetch, directional / hover gallery prefetch, and RAF/3FR skip of eager full demosaic neighbors.

#### ⭐ Star ratings
- Single view: clickable **1–5 stars** (replaces the old UI bookmark star there). Keyboard **1–5** rate; **0** clears. Bookmark toggle remains **↑**.
- Ratings persist to **XMP** sidecars.
- Gallery: rating badges on tiles; filter to **rating ≥ N**; can combine with bookmark filter.

#### 📷 Format & decode reliability
- **Nikon HE / HE\*** NEF: detect, avoid spurious “unsupported or corrupt” dialogs, open via embedded JPEG.
- Cold-open / first-paint orientation fixes (sideways / upside-down / blank first RAW).
- Rapid-navigation races (stuck on stale image, cancelled mid-flight decode).
- RAW recovery preview (**P**) and EDR path rawpy bugs fixed.
- **Zoom-on-click Fixes**: Fixed a bug class where clicking a gallery thumbnail could land on a zoomed-in image inherited from the previous view. Gallery clicks now guarantee settling at Fit-to-Window.
- **Worker Pool Starvation**: Sidecar applies no longer starve the gallery thumbnail worker pool.
- **Edit-base decoding**: Deduplicated concurrent edit-base decodes and fixed stale in-flight guards.
- **Edit / load perf (post-3.0)**: Corrected-WB files stay on the fast EA edit-base path (no AHD fallback); unpack stash LRU; half-size edit-base cache; Adjust live-drag uses a 640px base + lite PV2012 (full quality on slider release); optional sidecar browse apply is progressive (preview interim then full).
- **Adjust zoom vs lite preview (post-3.0)**: While Adjust is open, Fit may paint a 640px live-drag tier, but zooming to 100% restores the half-res settle buffer and does not queue a browse-path sensor decode; lite frames are not painted over a zoomed sharper buffer.
- **Effects refinements (post-3.0)**: Vignette uses LR Amount sign + paint-overlay falloff with Midpoint; Chroma NR Amount slider; Dodge/Burn Effect Strength (stops) separate from Brush Flow; identity tone curves no longer block Reset.
- **XMP presets (post-3.0)**: Managed `.xmp` library in Adjust (alongside Creative LUT).
- **Tile EXIF parses**: Stopped unnecessary per-tile RAW EXIF parses during edited-preview delivery to improve speed.

#### 🎨 Polish
- Shared **darkroom** color palette (`theme.py`) for widgets and chrome.
- Gallery disk-cache default flipped toward **JPEG** tiles (WebP remains available).
- Culling zoom glitches, Windows taskbar flicker on startup, discarded-photo-never-returns, and slow gallery multi-select fixes.

#### 📦 Lite packaging (精簡 B)
- **Lite keeps Adjust** (CPU Fast RAW + editor) but **omits PyTorch / kornia** — no GPU demosaic and no AI denoise export in Lite.
- Windows Lite pixi payload skips `torch` / `torchvision` / `kornia` so install size stays near the ~500 MB class instead of dragging CUDA wheels.
- Lite runtime default: `RAWVIEWER_PREFER_GPU_DECODE=0`. Full (CUDA) still prefers GPU demosaic when the backend is present.

#### 🎨 App icon
- Aviation aperture + F-35 silhouette (transparent corners for README). Hi-res `icons/appicon.png` (2048²) for splash/README; platform `.icns`/`.ico` for the app; simplified `favicon.ico` for small sizes.

#### ⚡ Nav / Adjust path speedups (upstream `b99a226`)
- Avoid UI-thread disk thumbs and half→full cache pollution; cancel stale gallery/decode work.
- Keep Dodge & Burn masks in-memory until save.
- Regroup Detail into **Noise Reduction / Effects / Local**, with a clearer **Export** control.
- WB dropper display-to-edit mapping fix; smooth-zoom full-decode retry after a refused queue; Adjust zoom / effects / presets hardening.

### Environment variables (new / notable)

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `RAWVIEWER_FAST_RAW_DECODE` | `1` | Fast RAW path; `0` falls back toward rawpy |
| `RAWVIEWER_USE_PROCESS_POOL` | auto | Force LibRaw process pool on/off |
| `RAWVIEWER_SIDECAR_ADJUST` | `0` | Apply saved XMP edit sliders to browse/full-res pixels (requires editing enabled). Default off: browse shows original; edits render in Adjust. When on, CURRENT full loads use progressive interim→full apply |
| `RAWVIEWER_UNPACK_STASH_SLOTS` | `3` | How many LibRaw unpack mosaics to keep for half→full / A↔B revisit (1–8) |

### Recommended test after upgrade

1. Optional: run **`clear_cache`** once if tiles look stale after the cache version bump.
2. Open a mix of ARW / CR3 / NEF (including HE\*): arrow through, zoom to 100%, confirm orientation.
3. Rate with **1–5**, filter gallery by stars, confirm sidecars.
4. Open Adjust (**E**): try WB presets, Crop (Transform), Dodge/Burn with Edge Assist, Vignette/Midpoint/Dehaze; after a Fit slider drag, double-click 100% and confirm status stays on the half-res settle size (not 640×427).

### ⚠️ Known Issues & Upcoming Features

- **Known Issue (Unstable Live Preview Updates)**: In the gallery view and single-image non-RAW mode, edited thumbnails/single images can sometimes display the original unedited embedded version instead of the edited version. This occurs due to cache synchronization delays and worker-thread queue performance under heavy load.
- **Known Issue (Unsupported RAW Formats for Editing)**: Nikon HE-NEF (High Efficiency) files cannot unpack the RAW image data, so SkySpotter can only show the embedded JPEG and they remain browse-only. The Adjust/Develop editing panel is disabled for these formats.
- **Upcoming Feature (Real-Time Live Edit Synchronization)**: True real-time live updates of adjustments to gallery view tiles and single-image non-RAW previews is planned for a future update to ensure smooth and stable visual synchronization.
- **Upcoming Feature (Local Masks — Brush / Gradient with Per-Mask Adjustments)**: A generalization of the Dodge & Burn mask into a list of local mask groups — painted brush, linear gradient, and radial gradient — each carrying its own subset of adjustments (Exposure, Temp/Tint, Contrast, Saturation, Clarity, Dehaze, Shadows/Highlights) applied as mask-weighted corrections, with inside/outside asymmetry via an invert toggle. Masks persist to XMP (gradients as parameters, brushes as bitmaps). Design draft: [`docs/LOCAL_MASKS_PLAN.md`](docs/LOCAL_MASKS_PLAN.md).

## 🚀 Version 2.5.0
**Release Date: July 3, 2026**

SkySpotter 2.5 is built for **serious libraries** — faster culling, smarter search, and a viewer that stays responsive from the first folder open to the ten-thousandth frame.

### 🚀 Key Feature Highlights

#### 🎨 Gallery & View
- **Gallery Zoom Slider** — A sleek wedge-shaped zoom track with **scroll anchoring**: the top-left thumbnail stays locked on screen while you resize the grid.
- **macOS HDR / EDR** — See HDR stills and RAW the way they were meant to look on supported Mac displays (HEIC, AVIF, 16-bit TIFF, and **RAW High Quality** workflow). Embedded JPEG preview stays SDR when you want speed.
- **Animated GIF & WebP** — Play, scale, and browse animated files natively in single-image view.
- **RAW recovery preview (P)** — Press **P** for an instant shadow/highlight recovery preview on RAW/DNG — judge extreme contrast without waiting for a full export. Session-only, fit view.
- **Clipping overlay (J)** — Press **J** to see exactly what's clipping — red for blown highlights, blue for crushed shadows — on both RAW and in Compare mode.

#### 👥 Culling & Comparison
- **Burst Image Grouping** — Rapid-fire sequences stack automatically by capture time. Double-click to expand and pick the keeper.
- **Dual-Pane Compare (C)** — Anchor vs. candidate, side by side. Promote (↑), reject to Discard (↓), or delete — with synced composition guides (**G**) and clipping overlays (**J**) on both panes. **Space** toggles synchronized zoom and pan across both panes; press **F** for focus overlays, then **Space** zooms each pane to its own AF/subject point for side-by-side sharpness checks.

#### 🗺️ Maps & Location Search
- **Interactive GPS Overlay (M)** — A live map card for geotagged shots, with one-click **Google Maps** from the coordinate badge.
- **Offline place search** — 100,000+ cities and landmarks resolved locally during indexing. Search `city:tokyo` or `country:jp` with **no internet** — ever.

#### ⚡ Performance at Scale
Built to stay fluid on **5k–10k+ image libraries**, whether you're on a fast internal SSD or a slow external drive.

**📦 Smarter cache**
- **WebP tiles** — New cache writes are smaller and faster to read; size-based LRU keeps disk use in check.
- **Your existing JPEG cache still works** — no forced migration. Clear cache manually only if you want immediate WebP savings.
- **One decode, many uses** — Preview, grid, and thumbnail tiers fill from a single pass instead of reopening every file.

**🤖 Background indexing that gets out of your way**
- **Two-phase indexing** — Metadata first, then AI embeddings (Full). Search unlocks when indexing is ready for your edition (metadata on Lite; metadata + AI on Full).
- **Scroll-aware** — Indexing pauses while you scroll the gallery and yields to foreground navigation so arrow keys stay smooth.

**⏱️ Snappier navigation**
- **Staggered prefetch** — Switching photos cancels low-priority loads; full-res neighbors wait until the current frame paints.
- **Off the UI thread** — Sorting, heavy conversions, and metadata work move to background workers — fewer micro-stutters.

**🪟 Windows polish**
- Fixed a GPU hand-off race when returning to the gallery after large single-image views.
- Gallery scrollbar jumps load visible tiles immediately.
- Optional stable file picker: `RAWVIEWER_QT_FILE_DIALOG=1`.

### Gallery reliability (large folders)
- **Folder switching** — Layout and thumbnail loads reset per folder; scattered tiles and blank gaps after changing albums are gone.
- **Huge folders** — Gallery opens in capture-time (EXIF) order; the Gallery button appears once that sort finishes (instant when metadata is fully cached).
- **Orientation-aware tiles** — EXIF display orientation is applied consistently when thumbnails enter the gallery grid, so portrait shots keep correct framing when you jump scroll position or enter the gallery from single view.

## 🚀 Version 2.4.1
**Release Date: June 19, 2026**

Bug-fix release for **Canon CR2/CR3** (and similar RAW) orientation and capture-date handling, plus **memory safety on relaunch** when session restore reopens a large folder. Treats **gallery mixed orientation**, **single-image rotation**, and **out-of-memory on restart** as separate issues.

### Gallery — mixed portrait / landscape thumbnails

Some users saw **some vertical shots correct and others sideways** in the gallery after upgrading to v2.4. That pattern usually means **old cached thumbnails or preview rows** (from before v2.4 orientation fixes) sitting beside freshly warmed ones — not only a live warm-up clash (semantic vs gallery indexing, addressed in v2.4).

**What's fixed in 2.4.1:**
- **EXIF cache validation** — Persisted orientation is checked against LibRaw flip and embedded-JPEG orientation; stale `orientation=1` rows for portrait Canon RAW are rejected and re-extracted.
- **Cache version bump** (`sensor_meta_ver` 9) — Forces refresh of outdated EXIF metadata on upgrade.
- **Thumbnail load repair** — When a cached gallery thumbnail's pixels don't match container orientation, it is corrected or dropped instead of reused.

**If thumbnails still look wrong once:** Run **`scripts/Launch/shell/clear_cache.sh`** (macOS) or **`clear_cache.bat`** (Windows), then reopen the folder. This clears mixed old/new cache in one step.

### Single-image view — rotation unlike gallery

Gallery and single view used **different preview paths**: gallery favored embedded JPEG previews (with EXIF transpose); opening from gallery could **force immediate full LibRaw decode** with wrong container orientation on Canon CR2/CR3.

**What's fixed in 2.4.1:**
- **Same preview pipeline** — RAW thumbnails prefer LibRaw's embedded JPEG segment; byte-scan fallbacks apply container orientation after decode.
- **Gallery → single** — No longer skips straight to full-resolution LibRaw; uses the same progressive preview → full decode path as normal navigation.
- **Unified orientation lookup** — Single view uses `EXIFExtractor` (LibRaw flip + embedded JPEG), not header-only exifread alone.
- **Canon CR2/CR3 metadata** — When exifread returns sparse tags, pyexiv2 fills in **orientation** and **DateTimeOriginal** (also improves capture-date sorting).

### Memory — relaunch / session restore (macOS & Windows)

On **8–16 GB** machines, closing SkySpotter and reopening it could restore the last folder and file while **full-resolution decode**, **neighbor prefetch**, and **AI/metadata indexing** all started in the same second — sometimes killing the app (macOS jetsam, exit **137**) or freezing Windows under heavy paging.

**What's fixed in 2.4.1:**
- **Staged session restore** — After the first preview paints, full decode for the current image waits **~2.5 s**, then neighbor prefetch waits **~0.8 s** more. Normal folder open and gallery navigation are unchanged.
- **Preview vs full cache tiers** — Full-resolution embedded JPEGs are stored separately from the smaller preview tier used for fit-to-window, reducing peak RAM during upgrades.
- **macOS memory stats fallback** — On newer macOS kernels where `psutil` fails, RAM tier and cache pressure use `sysctl` + `vm_stat` instead of a fake 50% value.

**What you might notice after relaunch:** Fit view may stay on a fast preview for a few seconds before full quality; arrow-key navigation to the next file may be slightly slower for the first ~3 s. **Space / double-click zoom to 100%** still requests full resolution immediately.

**If relaunch still fails on low RAM:** Use **Lite**, set `RAWVIEWER_DISABLE_SESSION_RESTORE=1`, or temporarily disable semantic search — see README troubleshooting.

**Tuning (optional):**

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `RAWVIEWER_SESSION_RESTORE_DEFER_PRELOAD` | `1` | Staged heavy loads after session restore |
| `RAWVIEWER_SESSION_RESTORE_FULL_DECODE_DELAY_MS` | `2500` | Delay before full decode on relaunch |
| `RAWVIEWER_SESSION_RESTORE_PRELOAD_DELAY_MS` | `800` | Extra delay before neighbor prefetch |
| `RAWVIEWER_DISABLE_SESSION_RESTORE` | `0` | Skip restoring last folder on launch |

### Recommended test after upgrade

1. Optional but best: **`clear_cache.sh`** once (orientation cache refresh).
2. Open a folder of Canon (or other) portrait RAWs — gallery should be consistent.
3. Click into single view — direction should match the gallery; full quality loads in the background.
4. **Relaunch test:** Close SkySpotter, reopen the same session on a large RAW folder — app should stay up; check logs for `[SESSION] Deferring heavy loads until first paint`.

## 🚀 Version 2.4
**Release Date: June 19, 2026**

### Highlights — new in 2.4

- **SkySpotter Lite** — A lighter edition for fast browsing and culling: smaller download, no AI model install, and gallery search by camera, ISO, date, GPS, and filename. On **Windows**, pick **Lite** in the installer; on **Mac**, use **`SkySpotter-v2.4-macOS-Lite.zip`**.
- **One Windows installer** — **`RAWviewer_Setup.exe`** is all you need. In the wizard, choose **Full (CUDA)**, **Full (DirectML)**, or **Lite** — no more hunting for separate setup files.
- **Drag photos out** — Drag a gallery thumbnail or a film-strip thumb to Explorer, Finder, Mail, WhatsApp (where supported), Lightroom, or any app that accepts files. Select several gallery photos first and drag once to export them all.
- **Composition guides** — Press **G** in single-image view to cycle overlays: rule of thirds, diagonals, or phi grid — handy for checking framing while you cull.
- **Bookmarks** — Star keepers per folder; filter the gallery to bookmarked shots only; share or slideshow your picks; works with gallery search (see below).
- **Release highlights image** — The GitHub release includes a new visual summary of v2.4 so you can see what's new at a glance before you download.

### Introducing SkySpotter Lite

**Lite is SkySpotter without the AI search engine** — built for photographers who want the same fast viewer, gallery, and culling workflow, but prefer a smaller install and snappier loading over plain-language search.

**What you keep (same as Full):**
- Open folders of RAW and JPEG, gallery grid, film strip, fit / 100% zoom, histogram, focus overlay, composition guides (**G**)
- Drag photos out to Explorer, Finder, Mail, or your editor
- Bookmarks, Discard folder, keyboard shortcuts
- Gallery search by **metadata** — camera, lens, ISO, date, city, filename, and more (e.g. `camera:sony iso<800`)

**What Lite leaves out:**
- **Semantic (AI) search** — you can't type `sunset on beach` and have the app guess meaning; use metadata filters or your eyes instead
- **Face-based filters** — no `has:face` / `people` style queries
- **AI model download** — no ~600 MB (Windows) or ~150 MB (Mac) model install

**Why Lite feels faster and uses less disk:**
- No background AI indexing eating CPU, GPU, and RAM while you browse
- Tuned prefetch so the next photos in the gallery and film strip load sooner when you scroll or arrow through a folder
- Smaller app footprint (~500 MB install vs ~1.5 GB+ for Full after models)

**How to get Lite:** On **Windows**, choose **Lite** in **`RAWviewer_Setup.exe`**. On **Mac**, download **`SkySpotter-v2.4-macOS-Lite.zip`**. Already on Full? You can install Lite side by side — they don't share the same shortcut name.

Not sure which to pick? **Lite** if you cull by eye and search by camera/date/location. **Full** if you want to describe photos in everyday words or filter by faces.

### Bookmarks

- **Mark keepers per folder** — Press **↑** to toggle. In **single view**, click the **star** on the bottom-right bar too.
- **Single-image view** — White star = bookmarked; outline star = not bookmarked. Click the star or press **↑** to toggle either way.
- **Gallery** — Star badges on thumbnails and in the film strip. **↑** toggles the current selection; with multiple thumbnails selected (**Ctrl/Cmd+click**, **Shift+click**), **↑** or the bottom **star** toggles all selected photos at once.
- **Bookmark-only gallery** — In gallery view, click the **outline star** (nothing selected) to show bookmarked photos only (star turns **gold**). Click again or press **Esc** to return to the full grid. With thumbnails selected, the star toggles bookmarks (same as **↑**).
- **Search + bookmarks** — Search still runs on the whole folder; the bookmark filter narrows what you **see**. Turn off the filter to see all search matches; clear search with the filter still on to see every bookmark.
- **Share / Open** — In **single view**, opens or shares the current photo. In **gallery**, the button appears when you multi-select photos **or** when bookmark filter is on. With filter on and nothing selected, it targets **all visible bookmarked** photos.
- **Slideshow** — Play button in gallery and single view. In bookmark-filter mode, slideshow cycles **bookmarked photos only**.
- **Esc order (gallery)** — Clears multi-select first, then exits bookmark filter (before leaving gallery from single view).
- **Persistence** — Bookmarks are saved per folder locally and restored when you reopen that folder.

### Improvements & fixes

- **Portrait photos look right** — Gallery thumbnails and the film strip no longer show vertical shots sideways or "twisted twice."
- **Smoother on huge folders (especially Mac)** — Large libraries scroll more reliably; the app eases off when your Mac is busy instead of freezing.
- **Gallery multi-select** — **Ctrl+click** (Windows) or **Cmd+click** (Mac) to pick photos; **Shift+click** for a range (follows visible gallery order, including search and bookmark filter). Works with drag-out and the bottom **Share / Open** bar.

### Gallery & everyday workflow

- **Multi-select** — Ctrl/Cmd+click toggles a thumbnail on or off; Shift+click selects a continuous range (great for picking a burst or a run of keepers).
- **Drag out** — One thumbnail drags one file; a multi-selection drags every selected file together.
- **No accidental re-open** — Dragging a photo from SkySpotter and dropping it back on the window no longer opens it again.
- **Search while indexing** — Progress messages stay clearer; Lite won't pretend AI search is ready when only metadata has finished indexing.

### Portrait orientation

- Vertical RAW and JPEG shots appear upright in the gallery grid and film strip.
- Cached thumbnails from older versions are refreshed when needed — run **`clear_cache`** once if you still see old sideways previews.

### Large libraries (Mac)

- Better behavior when a folder has thousands of photos — less stutter, fewer "system busy" moments.
- Background search/indexing pauses while you scroll the gallery and picks up again when you stop.
- On 8 GB Macs, the app stays conservative; on 16 GB+ machines it can work a bit harder automatically.

### Drag & drop

- **Gallery**: Drag one thumbnail, or drag while several are selected to export all of them.
- **Filmstrip**: Drag the active strip thumbnail the same way.
- **Drop in** (unchanged): Drag a folder or image onto the window to open it in SkySpotter.

### Install & uninstall

- **Windows install**: Unified **`RAWviewer_Setup.exe`** — choose **Full (CUDA / DirectML)** or **Lite** in the wizard; launch **`SkySpotter.exe`** (not Setup) after install. Default folder: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SkySpotter`.
- **Windows uninstall**: **Settings → Apps → SkySpotter → Uninstall**, or **`uninstall.bat`** in the install folder. Removes the app, **`%USERPROFILE%\.rawviewer_cache`**, and **`%LOCALAPPDATA%\SkySpotter`** logs/tiles. Set **`RAWVIEWER_UNINSTALL_FULL=1`** before **`uninstall.bat`** to also clear saved preferences.
- **macOS install**: Extract release zip → **`bash install_macos_app.sh`** (see **`Start Here.txt`** in the zip). Copies the app to **Applications** and clears download quarantine.
- **macOS uninstall**: Release zips include **`uninstall_macos_app.sh`** and **`Uninstall SkySpotter.command`** — removes **Applications** copies, **`~/.rawviewer_cache`**, logs, and preferences. Keep the zip (or re-download) to run uninstall later; Trash alone does not clear cache.
- **Documentation**: README, **`Start Here.txt`**, and **`scripts/Launch/README.md`** updated with install/uninstall steps and an uninstall-vs-**`clear_cache`** table for both platforms.

## 🚀 Version 2.3.2
**Release Date: June 8, 2026**

Installer and in-app MobileCLIP download UX, gallery bottom-bar layout, and clearer Hugging Face messaging.

### 🪟 Windows installer
- **Live model download progress**: The ~600 MB Hugging Face download maps to **5–100%** on the installer progress bar (no longer stuck at 75%).
- **Installer log + label**: Progress appears as **`Downloading... N%`** in the step label and install log (every 5%); ASCII-only text avoids console encoding glitches on Windows.
- **Cleaner subprocess output**: Silent Hugging Face tqdm bars; only `@RAWVIEWER_PROGRESS` lines drive the UI (`python -u`, `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`).
- **Byte-level reporting**: `download_mobileclip_onnx.py` streams progress parsed by the bootstrap installer.
- **Optional faster downloads**: Set a **`HF_TOKEN`** environment variable before setup if you use a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) account (inherits into the download subprocess).

### 🔍 Semantic search (all platforms)
- **In-app download progress in search field**: After you click **Download**, the gallery search bar shows **`Downloading... N%`** (same place as Metadata/Semantic/Face indexing). The prompt dialog closes immediately so the search field stays visible.
- **macOS Core ML downloads**: Per-file `hf_hub_download` with byte progress instead of opaque `snapshot_download`.
- **Shared progress helpers**: New `mobileclip_download_progress.py` used by installer scripts, bootstrap, and the main app.

### 🛠️ Gallery UI
- **Bottom bar button order**: **RAW/JPEG workflow** toggle now sits **before** the search icon so the search field expands right next to the search button (not with RAW sandwiched in between).

### 📖 Documentation
- README and release notes clarify models come from Hugging Face (~600 MB on Windows), installer progress behavior, and that first download may take longer without a Hugging Face account.

## 🚀 Version 2.3.1
**Release Date: June 7, 2026**

Focus overlays, RAW ↔ embedded-JPEG workflow, faster gallery indexing, background update checks, Windows installer stability, and macOS release packaging (Terminal install, in-app MobileCLIP download, SSL fix).

### 🔔 Release updates
- **Background check on launch**: Once per app start, SkySpotter quietly compares your version to the latest [GitHub release](https://github.com/markyip/SkySpotter/releases/latest) (offline or unreachable → no UI).
- **MD3 update prompt**: When a newer release is available, a styled dialog shows your version vs the latest tag and offers **Open Download Page** or **Not Now**.
- **Respectful snooze**: **Not Now** hides the prompt for **14 days** for that release; a **newer** release tag will notify you again sooner.
- **Opt out**: Set `RAWVIEWER_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable the check entirely.

### 🎯 Focus overlay (`F`)
- **Broader maker AF**: Nikon NEF (`AFInfo2`, image-height fallback), Olympus ORF (`AFPointSelected`, `AFFocusArea` / `AFSelectedArea`), Panasonic RW2 (`AFPointPosition`, including decimal `/1024` form), and refined Canon EOS point placement (center origin, Y-up).
- **Brand guide**: README documents which formats support maker-note AF vs CIPA `SubjectArea` only (e.g. Fujifilm RAF, Hasselblad 3FR, typical Adobe DNG, Pentax PEF, Samsung SRW, Sigma X3F).

### 🖼️ Viewing
- **RAW ↔ JPEG workflow (single view)**: One-click toggle on the bottom bar — **embedded JPEG** (fast) vs **full RAW decode** (high quality); switching clears display caches and reloads the current file. Shown in single view only, not in gallery grid.
- **Snappier RAW navigation**: Bidirectional **embedded-JPEG prefetch** (default radius **6**), **focus-anchored zoom** when upgrading resolution.
- **RAW zoom fix**: **Space** and **double-click** reach 100% zoom reliably on RAW when fit-to-window state was out of sync (Ctrl+scroll already worked).

### 🛠️ Gallery & navigation
- **Cleaner libraries**: Composite DNG panoramas (e.g. Lightroom/Photoshop HDR stitches) are hidden from the gallery and navigation lists.
- **Scroll-friendly indexing**: Background metadata and semantic indexing **pause while you scroll** the gallery and resume after idle, keeping large folders responsive.

### 🔍 Semantic search & indexing
- **Gallery thumbnail reuse**: Semantic warm-up reuses paths already in `ImageCache` (preview/grid tiers from loaded tiles), cutting duplicate RAW decodes during indexing.
- **Faster neural pass**: Auto-tuned MobileCLIP **batch size** on your GPU/CPU for higher indexing throughput.
- **Safer setup**: Incomplete ONNX installs report a clear reinstall hint instead of failing silently.

### 🪟 Windows installer & launch
- **Clearer release filenames**: **`RAWviewer_Setup_DirectML.exe`** (recommended) and **`RAWviewer_Setup_CUDA.exe`** replace the old single-file names.
- **Dedicated app launcher**: Install folder **`SkySpotter.exe`** is a small stub that starts the app; **`RAWviewer_Setup.exe`** in the same folder is for repair/reinstall only.
- **More reliable setup**: Pixi and MobileCLIP downloads retry on failure with clearer network/disk/proxy errors; canceling setup removes incomplete install folders; welcome page text simplified (no Ctrl+Shift+O / disk-space hints).
- **AI model install progress**: During the ~600 MB Hugging Face download, the installer progress bar and log show real transfer progress (no longer stuck at 75%).
- **MobileCLIP optional at install**: If AI models fail during setup, browsing still works; download them later from gallery **Search** (MD3 prompt + in-dialog progress, same style as macOS). Models are hosted on Hugging Face; without a Hugging Face account, the first download may take longer.
- **Uninstall fixes**: Settings → Apps and `uninstall.bat` work on Win11; a confirmation message appears when removal finishes.
- **Shortcuts button**: Status-bar **i** opens the keyboard-shortcuts dialog (not just a tooltip).

### 🍎 macOS
- **Release zip**: `SkySpotter-v2.3.1-macOS.zip` (~82 MB); minimum macOS **13.0**; bundles **scipy** (GPS reverse geocoding) and **pyexiv2**. MobileCLIP models are **not** in the zip.
- **Terminal install**: Extract the zip, then `bash install_macos_app.sh` in the extracted folder (see README).
- **In-app model download**: When the user opens **gallery search**, the app prompts to download MobileCLIP from Hugging Face (~150 MB on macOS, one-time, needs internet). Without a Hugging Face account, that download may take longer. No download prompt on app startup.
- **HTTPS / SSL fix**: Packaged app bundles **certifi** CA certificates and configures SSL before Hugging Face / tokenizer downloads, fixing `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]` on fresh installs.
- **Dock — single app icon**: LibRaw process pool **off by default** (PyInstaller runtime hook + spawn-safe startup); opt in with `RAWVIEWER_USE_PROCESS_POOL=1` (may bring back extra Dock entries).
- **Startup splash**: Dismisses automatically when the main window is ready (no extra click).
- **Gallery search crash (macOS 26+)**: NSTextField autocomplete disabled on the search field (including after focus and wake-from-sleep) to avoid ViewBridge / `SPCompletionListServiceViewController` aborts under Qt 6.11.

### 🏗️ Build
- **Removed unused `mediapipe`** from Windows `build.py` dependencies (face detection uses YuNet ONNX).
- **macOS SSL bundling**: PyInstaller collects **certifi** and runs an SSL runtime hook for HTTPS downloads in the packaged app.

## 🚀 Version 2.2
**Release Date: May 30, 2026**

Unified 2.2 release — search, gallery, film strip, frameless window polish, RAW loading consistency, indexing improvements, and macOS share behavior aligned with Qt6.

### 🎯 What's New
- **Search from single-image view**: Search button in single view; submitting a query switches to gallery with filtered results.
- **Fast single-file open**: Opening one image no longer waits for full folder scan and EXIF sort on large libraries.
- **Windows — Open with another app**: Native picker via `OpenAs_RunDLLW` / `SHOpenWithDialog` with `OAIF_EXEC` for Lightroom, Photoshop, etc., exposed through the bottom external-app button.
- **macOS — Share (single image)**: Bottom-bar share in single view uses a **Qt menu** of `NSSharingService` targets (Mail, Messages, …). AirDrop is hidden from the menu by default; use Finder for reliable AirDrop (see `docs/macos-sharing-v21-v22.md`).
- **Experimental GPU single-image view**: Opt in with `RAWVIEWER_GPU_VIEW=1` for smoother zoom/pan on supported hardware (classic scroll area remains the default).
- **Consistent RAW color (fit ↔ zoom)**: Single-image RAW defaults to LibRaw half-res for fit view and full decode at 100% zoom (`RAWVIEWER_LIBRAW_CONSISTENT_PREVIEW=1`), avoiding embedded-JPEG color snap. Gallery thumbnails still use fast embedded previews.
- **Unified EXIF dual-backend**: Metadata routes through `metadata_backend` — fast header reads for RAW, optional `pyexiv2` for JPEG/TIFF (`RAWVIEWER_EXIF_BACKEND=auto`).
- **Frameless window resize (Windows)**: Drag any window edge (including top strip and bottom-right grip) to resize; gallery scrollbar keeps original 24px / 6px padding with a non-layout overlay for right-edge grip.

### 🛠️ Fixes & improvements

**Search & gallery**
- **Search → gallery navigation**: Clicking a search result opens the correct image; film strip and arrow keys stay within filtered results.
- **Gallery refresh after EXIF sort**: Gallery auto-updates when background capture-time refinement completes.
- **Gallery thumbnails**: Click handler uses the widget's current path so reordered/filtered grids navigate correctly.
- **Search panel UI**: Collapsing the search field no longer shifts nearby status-bar icons; fixed width jump when clearing the query.
- **Search indexing UX**: No flash of stale `Semantic/Face X/10` progress after search completes; session-aware index status.
- **Semantic indexing**: Skip duplicate RAW companion files when writing to the index; resolved progress bar resets by scaling progress between thumbnail warming (10%) and MobileCLIP neural pass (90%); prevented brief double-count displays by filtering duplicate companion files in start fallbacks.

**Film strip & rotation**
- **Film strip animation**: Smooth fade-in/out when revealing or dismissing the single-image thumbnail strip; extended bottom hot zone.
- **Film strip hover**: Tuned show delays (350ms / 120ms direct) with prefetch so the strip feels responsive without flicker.
- **Film strip sync**: Fixed phantom selection, recursion on hover, and sync to search-filtered lists instead of the full folder.
- **Rotation consistency**: Non-destructive rotation stays aligned across single view, film strip, and gallery after `R` or arrow navigation.

**Performance & image pipeline**
- **Butter-smooth gallery scroll**: Faster scroll-speed detection and throttled prefetch during fast scrolling.
- **Fast-open / EXIF refinement**: Parallel capture-time probing, gated gallery EXIF sort, viewport scroll anchor on manual sort, instant gallery button when sort cache is warm.
- **GPU navigation**: Smoother gallery→single transitions and priority full-resolution decodes; 27% zoom race fix.
- **CPU downscaling**: Replaced LANCZOS with HAMMING for thumbnail downscales (faster, cleaner edges on CPU).
- **GPU viewport scaling**: Experimental GPU view uses hardware-accelerated scaling where enabled.
- **GPU single-view navigation**: Arrow keys and film strip keep the previous frame visible until the next buffer is ready; prefetched preview/full caches paint immediately; thumbnail-only stages are skipped during in-folder navigation to reduce flicker.
- **GPU fit ↔ 100% zoom**: Space and double-click now reach true 100% on the first action on RAW (fixes stale fit-mode flag showing ~fit% until a second toggle); resolution upgrades no longer undo an active 100% zoom.
- **Resolution crossfade (optional)**: Smoother preview→full upgrades in single view (`RAWVIEWER_RESOLUTION_CROSSFADE_MS`, default 280; set `RAWVIEWER_DISABLE_CROSSFADE=1` to disable).
- **Idle display prefetch**: Neighbor images warm preview/full buffers while browsing (`RAWVIEWER_IDLE_DISPLAY_PREFETCH`, `RAWVIEWER_NAV_PRELOAD_*`).
- **Multi-core RAW postprocess**: Process pool for LibRaw when `RAWVIEWER_USE_PROCESS_POOL=1` (default on 4+ cores).
- **Progressive RAW load**: Optional embedded-first path via `RAWVIEWER_PROGRESSIVE_RAW_LOAD=1` (off by default).

**Platform & docs**
- **macOS share under Qt6**: Default dev/shipping path uses Qt menu + `performWithItems_`; picker fallback and AirDrop/Finder behavior documented in `docs/macos-sharing-v21-v22.md`.
- **Folder sort**: Production uses EXIF / probe / birth / mtime only; Windows Shell `DateTaken` POC removed.
- **`clear_cache.bat` / `clear_cache.sh`**: Full dev/session reset; repo-root `clear_cache.bat` forwards to `scripts/Launch/bat/clear_cache.bat`.
- **Windows share helper** (sources retained): .NET `WindowsShareHelper.exe` for WinRT share in dev builds.
- **Launch scripts**: macOS build/test workflow in `scripts/Launch/README.md`; version aligned across `build.py`, `pixi.toml`, and `QApplication`.
- **Environment**: `activation.env` with `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` to prevent global package leaks and splash issues.

## 🚀 Version 2.1.0
**Release Date: May 28, 2026**

🎯 What's New
- **Film strip (single-image view)**: Bottom thumbnail strip on pointer hover; dismisses when leaving the strip or entering the status bar.
- **Launch scripts**: Debug and build entry points moved to `scripts/Launch/` (`bat/` on Windows, `shell/` on macOS); root scripts forward for compatibility.
- **Semantic + face indexing (Windows)**: Phased indexing (metadata → MobileCLIP embeddings → background face backfill), resume from `semantic_index.db`, DirectML-accelerated ONNX on Windows when available.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **Installer model download**: Added `requests` to Pixi dependencies so `huggingface_hub` can download MobileCLIP ONNX models on first install (public models on Hugging Face).
- **Indexing stability**: Stronger RAW thumbnail fallbacks, skip permanently unindexable files, conservative face-scan warm-up defaults, clearer progress phases.
- **Delete confirmation dialog**: Centered on the main window using global coordinates.
- **Face detection threshold**: YuNet / SSD confidence raised to **0.75** (fewer false positives).
- **Logging**: Persistent logs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SkySpotter\logs\`; installer no longer bundles old `src/logs`.
- **Dependencies**: `pixi.toml` is the source of truth; legacy `requirements.txt` removed.
- **Docs**: Pixi-first build instructions, minimum macOS 13 for prebuilt releases.

Includes fixes from **2.0.1** (Pixel DNG, gallery aspect ratio, DNG single-view zoom).

---

## 🚀 Version 2.0.1
**Release Date: May 23, 2026**

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **Google Pixel DNG Support**: Fixed critical crashes in the `QImageReader` and `EXIFExtractor` fallbacks that prevented Google Pixel DNG files from rendering on macOS.
- **Gallery Aspect Ratio Fix**: Fixed a bug where thumbnail crops were improperly bypassed, ensuring that all gallery tiles now correctly display cropped square previews without distorted aspect ratios or zoomed-in glitches.
- **DNG Single-View Zoom Stability**: Reworked DNG single-image loading to use a full-resolution-first path and tightened pending zoom-state handling, fixing intermittent cases where Space / double-click changed zoom status text without actually zooming the image.

---

## 🚀 Version 2.0.0
**Release Date: May 7, 2026**

🎯 What's New
- **Local Semantic Search**: Cross-platform natural-language gallery search. Harness the power of MobileCLIP (Core ML on macOS, ONNX on Windows) to rank images by meaning (e.g., "sunny landscape" or "vintage portrait").
- **Structured Metadata Filters**: Powerful new query syntax to narrow by `camera:`, `lens:`, `iso:`, `ext:`, and more.
- **Slideshow Mode**: Automatic hands-free playback of your photos with adjustable intervals.
- **macOS Native Share**: Integration with the native macOS share sheet for instant sending via Mail, AirDrop, or Messages.
- **High-Fidelity Rendering**: New LANCZOS resampling and 2x JPEG oversampling for razor-sharp display on 4K and Retina screens.
- **Native macOS & Windows Shell Integration**: Improved Windows shell verbs and deep Finder/Explorer compatibility.
- **Non-Destructive Rotation**: Instantly rotate any image (including RAW) by 90° steps visually without modifying the original file.
- **Massive Location Intelligence**: Added ~150+ world cities to the GPS contradiction filter and improved multi-word place detection (e.g., "Hong Kong").
- **Precision Focus Overlays**: Added focus point visualization using MakerNote data for Canon, Nikon, and Sony.

🛠️ Fixes & improvements
- **High-Quality RAW Fallback**: Automatically triggers high-quality "fast RAW decode" for files with poor-quality embedded previews.
- **Performance Hardening**: Refactored `UnifiedImageProcessor` to open RAW files exactly once, drastically reducing Disk I/O.

### ⌨️ Keyboard & Gesture Map
- **Space / Double-click**: Toggle between "Fit to Window" and 100% zoom.
- **Pinch-to-Zoom**: Smoothly zoom in/out via trackpad or Ctrl+Scroll Wheel.
- **Left / Right Arrow**: Navigate between images (preserves zoom level).
- **Down Arrow**: Move current image to "Discard" folder.
- **Delete**: Remove the current image.
- **H / F**: Toggle Histogram / Focus Subject outlines.
