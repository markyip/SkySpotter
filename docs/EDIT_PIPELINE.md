# Edit Pipeline — Adjust Panel, Metadata & Roadmap

**Status:** Implemented (v2.5+ dev branch)  
**Toggle:** **E** in single-image view (RAW/DNG)  
**Tests:** `PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/phase_develop_adjust_linear.py`

> Renamed from `ADJUST_LINEAR_PIPELINE.md` (2026-07-04) — the scene-linear
> tone/color pipeline below is still the core of this doc, but it now also
> tracks feasibility investigations for adjacent editor features (rating/XMP
> compatibility, geometry/perspective tools, local/masked adjustments) that
> don't belong in the pipeline itself. See the **Roadmap investigations**
> section near the end for those.

## Goal

Replace **8-bit sRGB / gamma-space** adjust preview with a **scene-linear** pipeline so exposure, WB, and tone controls behave predictably and align with Lightroom / Camera Raw ordering at a lite tier. Non-destructive settings are stored in XMP sidecars; exports can bake pixels or copy RAW + XMP for round-trip editing.

## Implementation summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Scene-linear decode (fast EA / AHD fallback, 16-bit) | Done | Half-res preview; full-res export; `user_wb` stays on fast path (see Performance review #25) |
| PV2012 tone (ProcessVersion 11.0) | Done | Base curve + HS/W/B in perceptual space; live-drag uses `preview_lite` (#26) |
| Point tone curve UI | Done | `tone_curve_widget.py`; `_SHOW_TONE_CURVE_UI = True` in panel (re-enabled 2026-07-04) |
| Parametric tone regions | Done | PV Shad / Dark / Light / High (same flag); monotonicity bug fixed before re-enabling (see Performance review #14) |
| HSL (8 colors) | Done | UI on (`_SHOW_HSL_UI = True`); float32 HSV scale fixed (Performance review #6) |
| Creative LUT (.cube) | Done | Managed library + amount; display-stage apply (`raw_lut.py`) |
| Detail (Sharpness / Clarity / Defringe) | Done | Display-linear, after tone map |
| Chroma / Luma NR | Done | Both bilateral filter, no NLM/uint8 quantization; Luma NR is new (see Performance review #11/#12). Chroma NR also gets a downsample/blur/upsample coarse pass for blotchy noise a bilateral kernel can't reach (see Performance review #20) |
| Recovery baseline | Legacy | UI removed 2026-07; flag still honored if present in adj dict |
| Recovery ↔ Adjust UX | Done | P blocked while Adjust open |
| Recovery slider hints | Done | Shadows +40 / Highlights −35 when recovery flag on |
| Multi-format export | Done | TIFF16 / JPEG / WebP baked only — DNG options removed (see Export formats) |
| XMP sidecar I/O | Done | Basic + tone curve + HSL; as-shot Temp |
| Background preview worker | Done | 80 ms throttle; generation merge; uint8 encode guard |
| sRGB encode LUT | Done | `_encode_srgb8`/`_encode_srgb16` use a precomputed LUT instead of per-pixel `np.power`; ~2.7× faster (see Performance review) |
| Saturation / Vibrance color fix | Done | Now scales HSV S in gamma-encoded space via a LUT round-trip, not additive chroma in scene-linear space (see Performance review) |
| Gallery "edited" badge | Done | Lightweight pencil badge on RAW tiles with a saved XMP sidecar |
| Gallery / browse edited pixels | Partial | On Adjust save, bake editor render into thumb/grid/preview cache (aligned with panel). Default browse still does **not** re-run `SIDECAR_ADJUST` per tile. Companion JPEGs never get RAW XMP. |
| Creative LUT UI | Done | Drag-drop `.cube` + manage list + amount in Adjust panel |
| White balance dropper | Done | Small icon-only button inline in Temperature row; click a neutral area to solve Temperature/Tint (GPU single-view only) |
| Compare with original (split view) | Done | Icon-only toggle in panel header; draggable divider shows original (left) vs live edited (right) over the same `GpuImageView` — see Compare with original section (2026-07-05) |
| Lens profile correction | Done | `lensfunpy` geometric distortion correction; toggle only shown when a profile matches the file's camera+lens; baked in at decode time, not per-tick (see Lens profile correction section, 2026-07-05) |
| Keyboard / focus fixes | Done | Shortcuts work with panel open |
| Value readout styling | Done | Blue `#90CAF9` (was low-contrast gray on dark card) |
| Slider visual language | Done | Custom-painted center-out bipolar fill, rectangular thumb, Temp/Tint gradient hints — see Slider visual language section (2026-07-06) |
| Effects (vignette / dehaze) | Done | Paint-overlay vignette + Midpoint; LR Amount sign; whole-frame (not per-band) |
| Dodge/Burn Effect Strength | Done | `DodgeBurnStrength` stops separate from Brush Flow |
| XMP presets | Done | Managed `.xmp` library (import/apply/remove), same chrome as Creative LUT (`raw_xmp_presets.py`) |
| Adjust zoom vs lite preview | Done | Zoomed-in view keeps settle buffer; Fit may use 640px lite — see Performance review #27 |
| Identity tone-curve = default | Done | `tone_curve_serial_is_active()` so Reset / `is_default` treat `"0,0;255,255"` as unset |

**Not supported:** Lightroom-style radial/gradient/brush masks (beyond dodge/burn), layers. Per-channel RGB tone curves **are** supported (`ToneCurvePV2012Red/Green/Blue`, applied post-encode like LR Standard mode).

## Adjustments implemented

### Basic — Light

| Control | XMP key | Range | Pipeline stage |
|---------|---------|-------|----------------|
| Exposure | `Exposure2012` | −5 … +5 EV | Scene-linear multiply (fixed range = LR / XMP standard) |
| Contrast | `Contrast2012` | −100 … +100 | PV2012 perceptual |
| Highlights | `Highlights2012` | −100 … +100 | PV2012 perceptual |
| Shadows | `Shadows2012` | −100 … +100 | PV2012 perceptual |
| Whites | `Whites2012` | −100 … +100 | PV2012 perceptual |
| Blacks | `Blacks2012` | −100 … +100 | PV2012 perceptual |

### Tone curve

| Control | XMP / internal | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Point curve | `crs:ToneCurvePV2012` / `_tone_curve_pv2012` | Draggable graph (`ToneCurveWidget`); non-monotonic shapes are a valid user choice, not a bug |
| PV Shadows | `ParametricShadows` | |
| PV Darks | `ParametricDarks` | |
| PV Lights | `ParametricLights` | |
| PV Highlights | `ParametricHighlights` | |

Re-enabled 2026-07-04 (`_SHOW_TONE_CURVE_UI = True` in `adjust_panel.py`) after
fixing a monotonicity bug in `apply_parametric_tone_curve`
(`raw_tone_curve.py`) found during the re-enable review: `ParametricShadows`
+100 and `ParametricHighlights` -100 both made the combined tone curve
locally decreasing (banding), for the exact same reason as the
`raw_pv2012.py` shadow-lift bug fixed earlier (same `_smooth_weight`/
`_SPLIT_SHADOWS=0.25` region shape, worst slope ~5.89-5.90, needing
coefficient ≤~0.17). Fixed the same way: coefficient reduced 0.35→0.15. See
Performance review #14.

### Basic — Color

| Control | XMP key | Range | Pipeline stage |
|---------|---------|-------|----------------|
| Temperature | `Temperature` | As-shot ± slider | Scene-linear WB vs as-shot Kelvin |
| Tint | `Tint` | −150 … +150 | Green–magenta on G channel |
| Saturation | `Saturation` | −100 … +100 | HSV S-scale, gamma-encoded space (see Performance review) |
| Vibrance | `Vibrance` | −100 … +100 | HSV S-scale, low-sat weighted, gamma-encoded space |

**Temperature default:** On first open (no XMP), Temp = **as-shot** from EXIF / RAW metadata (`AsShotTemperature` internal key). LibRaw uses `use_camera_wb=True`, so slider at as-shot = neutral.

### White balance dropper

Small icon-only button (eyedropper, `fa5s.eye-dropper`) inline at the end of the
Temperature slider row (`adjust_panel.py`) — matches the app's existing muted
icon-button language (`#B0B0B0` default / `#90CAF9` accent when armed, same
rgba border/background as the Chroma NR toggle) rather than a labeled button.
Click it, then click a neutral gray/white area in the image; Temperature/Tint
are solved so that pixel becomes neutral, then applied and saved like a normal
slider release. Esc (or the button again) cancels an armed pick without
sampling.

- **Coordinate mapping**: `GpuImageView.set_color_pick_mode(True)` arms a
  one-shot crosshair click that emits `colorPickRequested(QPointF)` in
  **display-pixmap** image-pixel coordinates. The host maps that point into
  the as-shot linear sample buffer with the same uniform scale D&B uses
  (`raw_transform.map_display_point_to_buffer`), and the sample buffer itself
  is `apply_geometry(edit_base)` so crop / straighten / keystone match what
  is on screen (uncropped crop-overlay preview skips geometry). Arming the
  dropper requests a full-quality settle and blocks lite paints while armed.
- **Sample source**: averages a 7×7 neighborhood from that geometry-framed
  scene-linear edit buffer (as-shot camera WB, pre Temperature/Tint) — not
  the post-tone-map / post-gamma preview pixmap, so the solve isn't confused
  by tone-mapping or other slider adjustments already applied.
- **Math** (`raw_adjustments.solve_white_balance_from_sample`): an exact inverse of
  `_apply_wb_tint`, not new color science. Temperature scales R/B oppositely
  relative to G, so the R/B ratio depends only on Temperature — solved by
  bisection (monotonic over 2000-12000K). Tint (which only scales G) is then
  solved algebraically so G matches. Re-applying the solved values makes the
  clicked pixel exactly neutral, by construction.
- **Known limitation**: Tint's underlying model only scales G by ±10%
  (`raw_adjustments._apply_wb_tint`: `1 - (tint/150)*0.1`), so samples with a
  strong green/magenta cast clamp at the ±150 Tint boundary without fully
  neutralizing — a pre-existing constraint of the WB model, not something the
  dropper introduces. Samples requiring a Temperature outside 2000-12000K clamp
  the same way.
- **Scope**: GPU single-image view only (`self.gpu_view`); not wired into the
  legacy `QScrollArea`/`QLabel` fallback (`RAWVIEWER_GPU_VIEW=0`).
- **Fix (2026-07-06)**: user reported the dropper button "doesn't respond at
  all". `ImageAdjustPanelWidget._pointer_on_interactive_child` (the check
  that decides whether a click starts dragging the floating panel or should
  reach a child slider/button/combo) used `QApplication.widgetAt(global_pos)`
  — global, OS/compositor-level hit-testing. Confirmed directly: this can
  return `None` at a screen position a child widget genuinely, visibly
  occupies (reproduced with the WB button specifically), which is a known
  class of unreliability for translucent, borderless overlay widgets like
  this panel — the OS-level compositor doesn't necessarily agree with Qt's
  own widget tree about what's "on top" at a given global pixel. Replaced
  with `self.childAt(local_pos)` (pure local widget-tree hit-testing —
  "which of *my own* children is here", immune to compositor/global-coordinate
  ambiguity). Re-verified: the check now correctly identifies the button at
  its real position, the button's own click handling is unaffected, and
  panel drag-to-move (the other half of the same gating logic, for clicks on
  the panel's empty background) still works. This same gating function
  covers every other button/slider in the panel too, so the fix isn't
  dropper-specific even though that's the control the bug was reported on.
- **Misdiagnosed as still-broken, actually a Compare-mode bug (2026-07-06)**:
  user re-tested and reported the button still "doesn't respond" — but only
  while the Compare-with-original split view (below) was active. Real-app
  repro with temporary step-by-step logging (`adjust_panel._on_wb_picker_toggled`
  → `main._on_adjust_wb_picker_toggled`'s gating → `GpuImageView.
  set_color_pick_mode` → `GpuImageView.mousePressEvent`'s color-pick branch →
  `colorPickRequested` → `main._on_wb_color_picked`) showed the *entire chain
  fires correctly every time*, including while comparing — the dropper was
  never actually broken. What the user was seeing was two separate Compare
  bugs (see that section's "Divider stuck full-frame on first toggle" and
  "Crosshair cursor clobbered while comparing" entries) that made a
  successful pick look like nothing had happened: the mis-cropped divider
  hid the edited (post-pick) side entirely, and the picker's crosshair
  cursor was being reset to the arrow on every mouse move, making the
  armed state look inactive. Once those two were fixed, the dropper's own
  code needed no changes at all. The temporary `[WB]`-tagged logging added
  during this investigation was removed once the real root cause was found
  elsewhere.

### Compare with original (2026-07-05)

Icon-only toggle in the panel header (`fa5s.columns`, same muted-icon-button
language as the WB dropper). When armed, shows a draggable-divider split view
over the current image: the unedited (all-default-adjustments) render on the
left of the divider, the live edited preview on the right. Drag the divider
(or click near it) to move the split; toggle the button again to exit.

- **Architecture**: purely an overlay on `GpuImageView`, no change to the
  existing zoom/pan/fit/pixmap machinery. `self._item` (the always-current
  edited pixmap) is left completely alone — a new `_compare_overlay_item`
  (`QGraphicsPixmapItem`, zValue above `_item`) holds the *original* render
  cropped to the region left of the divider, plus a `QGraphicsLineItem`
  divider and a small `QGraphicsEllipseItem` handle. Because these are normal
  scene items, they zoom/pan with the image for free, and the edited side
  keeps live-updating from ordinary slider drags without any special-casing
  (the overlay just sits on top of whatever `_item` currently shows).
- **Getting the "original"**: `_AdjustCompareOriginalWorker` (`main.py`) runs
  `apply_adjustments_to_rgb(base_rgb, DEFAULT_ADJUSTMENTS)` off the GUI
  thread — this hits `process_linear_edit_buffer`'s existing "adjustments are
  all default" fast path (decode + sRGB encode only, no WB/denoise/tone math),
  so it's cheap without needing its own preview-stage cache. Cached per file
  (`_adjust_compare_original_pixmap`/`_path`) so re-toggling compare on/off
  doesn't recompute; invalidated in `_reset_adjust_compare_state()`, called
  from both `_begin_adjust_editing_session` (new file / fresh editing
  session) and the Adjust-panel-close path in `_set_adjust_panel_visible` —
  the same two places that already reset `_adjust_preview_base_rgb`.
- **Divider interaction**: hit-tested in view-space pixels (`±8px`, mapped
  through `mapFromScene`) so the grab target stays a constant on-screen size
  regardless of zoom, the same cosmetic-pen pattern used for the composition
  grid overlay. Drag handling is intercepted in `mousePressEvent`/
  `mouseMoveEvent`/`mouseReleaseEvent` ahead of the existing pan/export-drag
  logic, mirroring how `_color_pick_mode` already takes priority there for
  the WB dropper.
- **Verified**: headless-Qt tests (`QTest.mousePress/mouseMove/mouseRelease`)
  confirming compare mode refuses to arm without an original pixmap, the
  overlay crop width tracks the split fraction exactly, dragging the divider
  moves the split monotonically in the dragged direction, and toggling off
  hides the overlay/divider/handle; a direct test that
  `_AdjustCompareOriginalWorker`'s output is byte-identical to
  `apply_adjustments_to_linear(base, DEFAULT_ADJUSTMENTS)` and differs from
  an edited render. Not added to `phase_develop_adjust_linear.py` (that suite
  is pixel-math-only and PyQt6-free by design) — this is GUI wiring around
  already-tested pipeline functions, verified the same ad hoc headless-Qt way
  the tone curve widget's drag lifecycle was.
- **Scope**: GPU single-image view only, same as the WB dropper.
- **Bug: divider stuck full-frame on first toggle (2026-07-06)**: user
  reported that the *first* time Compare is toggled on, the original render
  fills far more of the frame than the split fraction implies and the
  divider doesn't visibly track drags — but toggling off and back on "fixes"
  it. Root cause: `GpuImageView.set_pixmap()` updates `_img_w`/`_img_h` (the
  values `_update_compare_overlay()` uses to convert the `0..1` split
  fraction into a pixel crop/divider position) but never re-ran the overlay
  math itself. On a fresh file, Compare can be armed before the Adjust
  panel's own (smaller, edit-base-resolution) preview pixmap has replaced
  whatever was on screen first (e.g. a native-resolution embedded-JPEG
  preview) — confirmed directly by logging `_update_compare_overlay`'s
  inputs on a real repro: first call saw `img_w=7008` against
  `src_w=3514` (the "original" render, always sized to the edit base), a
  ~2x mismatch that put the crop and divider well off from where the split
  fraction intended. By the second toggle, the Adjust preview pixmap had
  already landed (`img_w` now `3514`, matching `src_w`), so it looked
  "fixed" purely by timing luck, not because anything was actually
  resolved. **Fix**: `set_pixmap()` now calls `self._update_compare_overlay()`
  whenever it changes `_img_w`/`_img_h` while `_compare_active` is true, so
  the crop/divider can never go stale relative to whatever's currently
  displayed, regardless of which render (native preview vs. edit-base
  preview vs. a later resolution change) arrives first. Verified on a real
  repro: first-ever toggle now centers correctly immediately, no re-toggle
  needed.
- **Bug: WB crosshair cursor clobbered while comparing (2026-07-06)**: found
  while investigating the "WB dropper doesn't respond" report above — the
  pick itself worked the whole time, but `GpuImageView.mouseMoveEvent`'s
  divider-hover cursor logic (`if self._compare_active: ... setCursor(SplitHCursor)
  / unsetCursor()`) ran unconditionally whenever Compare was active, with no
  check for `_color_pick_mode`. Moving the mouse away from the divider while
  the WB picker was armed (crosshair set by `set_color_pick_mode`) hit the
  `unsetCursor()` branch on every move, immediately reverting to the arrow
  cursor — making the armed dropper look inactive even though clicking still
  correctly sampled and applied white balance. **Fix**: guarded the whole
  divider-hover-cursor block with `and not self._color_pick_mode`, so the
  crosshair now persists for the entire time the picker is armed, matching
  its behavior outside Compare mode. Verified on a real repro.

### Lens profile correction (2026-07-05)

Automatic geometric distortion correction driven by a `lensfunpy` profile
lookup keyed on camera make/model + lens make/model + focal length +
aperture. New module: `raw_lens_correction.py`. Toggle in the panel (styled
identically to the Chroma NR on/off button) is **hidden by default and only
shown once a matching profile is confirmed** for the current file — no
profile, no button, per the original ask.

- **Dependency**: `lensfunpy` added to `pixi.toml` `[pypi-dependencies]`
  (cross-platform, no per-target section needed — prebuilt wheels bundle
  the lensfun C library + database for Linux/macOS/Windows). `pixi install`
  resolves cleanly; `lensfunpy.Database()` loads 948 cameras / 1304 lenses
  with no separate download step.
- **Lookup key**: `raw_lens_correction.lens_profile_key_from_exif()` builds
  `(camera_make, camera_model, lens_make, lens_model, focal_length,
  aperture)` from the dict `EXIFExtractor.extract_exif_data()` already
  returns — camera fields and formatted focal/aperture strings were already
  parsed there for display; lens model is pulled from the raw EXIF tag dict
  using the same `EXIF LensModel` / `MakerNote LensType` / `Lens` /
  `Image LensModel` / `Composite LensID` fallback chain already used for
  search indexing (`semantic_search.py`). Returns `None` (no lookup
  attempted) if any of the five fields is missing.
- **Matching is strict-only, never `loose_search=True`**: caught during
  development — `lensfunpy`'s `loose_search=True` is not a tighter fuzzy
  match, it's a "return every lens on this camera's mount" fallback when
  nothing matches (confirmed: a made-up lens name returned all ~80 Canon EF
  lenses in the database). Using it would silently apply a *wrong* lens's
  distortion correction to the image — actively corrupting geometry while
  claiming success. `lensfunpy`'s strict mode already normalizes case and
  whitespace on its own (confirmed: `"canon"`/`"Canon"` and
  `"EF16-35mm..."`/`"EF 16-35mm..."` both match), so strict-only is not
  overly brittle.
- **Applied once at decode time, not per-tick**: unlike every tone/color
  slider, this has no continuous "amount" -- it's either the exact profile
  match or nothing. `UnifiedImageProcessor.decode_raw_edit_base()` gained an
  `apply_lens_correction: bool` parameter; when true, the decoded (and
  already orientation-corrected) buffer is undistorted via
  `raw_lens_correction.apply_lens_correction()` before being returned as the
  edit base. This means toggling it triggers a full re-decode
  (`_begin_adjust_editing_session`, which already resets
  `_adjust_preview_base_rgb`/the compare-original cache/`PreviewStageCache`
  correctly via existing base-identity invalidation) rather than a
  pipeline-stage recompute — simpler than threading a new stage through
  `PreviewStageCache`, and correct, since geometry has to be settled before
  any of WB/denoise/tone/detail run on the buffer.
- **Correction math**: `lensfunpy.Modifier(lens, cam.crop_factor, w, h)` +
  `.initialize(focal, aperture, pixel_format=...)` +
  `.apply_geometry_distortion()` returns an `(h, w, 2)` float32 coordinate
  map, fed directly to `cv2.remap()` (already a dependency). Confirmed the
  map is independent of the `pixel_format` argument passed to `initialize()`
  (only affects vignetting, unused here) and that `cv2.remap` preserves
  dtype for both `uint16` (the edit base's actual dtype) and `float32`.
- **Availability check**: `UnifiedImageProcessor.lens_profile_available()`
  does the same EXIF-based lookup (cheap on repeat calls — EXIF is
  SQLite-cached) and is called from `_AdjustEditBaseWorker` alongside the
  decode itself, so there's no extra I/O round-trip just to decide whether
  to show the toggle. Result flows back through `_AdjustEditBaseSignals`
  (gained a third `bool` field) to `_on_adjust_edit_base_ready`, which calls
  `panel.set_lens_correction_available(...)`.
- **Persistence**: `LensCorrectionEnabled` (0.0/1.0) added to
  `DEFAULT_ADJUSTMENTS` — this alone gets it full XMP read/write for free
  via the existing flat-dict `crs:` sidecar mechanism, no new XMP code
  needed. Off by default: an automatic geometry change must never apply
  silently to a file that didn't have it enabled before.
- **Export**: `_AdjustExportWorker` reads `LensCorrectionEnabled` from the
  adjustments dict being exported and passes it to the full-resolution
  `decode_raw_edit_base()` call, so a baked export matches whatever the
  preview showed.
- **Verified**: `raw_lens_correction.py` has real smoke tests in
  `phase_develop_adjust_linear.py` (`test_lens_profile_key_from_exif`,
  `test_lens_correction_gates_and_corrects_only_known_profiles`) — a known
  camera+lens combo actually changes pixel positions (and preserves
  dtype/shape for both `uint16` and `float32`), an unmatched lens returns
  the input completely unchanged (the strict-only-matching regression
  guard), and missing/`None` EXIF is handled without raising. These tests
  skip cleanly (not fail) when run outside the pixi env, since this
  session's ad hoc `python3 scripts/...` invocations use a different,
  older environment than pixi's that doesn't have `lensfunpy` installed —
  run via `pixi run python3 scripts/phase_develop_adjust_linear.py` to
  actually exercise them. Also verified the full signal chain headlessly
  (Qt): toggle hidden by default, shown/hidden correctly as
  `set_lens_correction_available()` is called, toggling emits the dedicated
  `lens_correction_toggled` signal (not the generic preview-refresh path),
  and `_AdjustEditBaseWorker` threads `apply_lens_correction` through to
  `decode_raw_edit_base` correctly.
- **Not implemented**: vignetting and TCA (chromatic aberration) correction
  — `lensfunpy` supports both (`apply_color_modification`,
  `apply_subpixel_distortion`), but "aspect correction" was the ask; a
  reasonable future extension, not a gap in this pass. Auto-crop-to-remove-
  empty-borders is also not implemented — `lensfunpy`'s automatic scale
  (`scale=0.0`, the default) already minimizes empty edges from the geometry
  correction itself, and no border cropping was observed in testing, so this
  wasn't pursued further.

### Slider visual language (2026-07-06)

Referenced a Lightroom-style HTML/CSS mockup the user shared
(`pyqt-lightroom-panel.html`) for the panel's slider look. Adopted the
mockup's *structural* signature — center-out bipolar fill, a compact
rectangular thumb, dim gradient hints for Temperature/Tint — but kept
RAWviewer's own existing accent color (`#90CAF9`, already used by the WB
dropper/Compare button/tone curve line) rather than the mockup's cyan, and
muted the gradient hues rather than lifting its saturated hex values
verbatim, so the result reads as consistent with the rest of the app's
established chrome instead of a second, competing accent.

- **The problem being fixed**: `QSlider`'s Qt Style Sheets (`sub-page`/
  `add-page`) can only fill from one *edge* of the groove — there's no QSS
  way to fill from an interior point. For a bipolar `-100..+100` slider,
  the old QSS-only styling filled from the left edge regardless of sign, so
  a slider sitting at `0` (no adjustment) still showed roughly half the
  track solid blue, which reads as "already adjusted" when it isn't.
- **Implementation**: `AdjustSlider` (`adjust_panel.py`) now fully overrides
  `paintEvent` (no QSS groove/handle/sub-page rules left — dead code
  removed) and draws its own track, fill, and thumb. Deliberately does
  **not** touch `mousePressEvent`/`mouseMoveEvent` at all — click/drag
  hit-testing stays exactly Qt's own default `QSlider` behavior. The paint
  code positions everything using the *same* `QStyle.subControlRect`/
  `QStyle.sliderPositionFromValue` calls Qt's own mouse handling uses
  internally, so the painted thumb and the actual click/drag target are
  pixel-exact by construction — no risk of the classic "visual thumb is
  slightly off from where clicking actually registers" bug a hand-rolled
  coordinate system could introduce.
- **Center point is configurable, not just "0"**: `set_center_value()`
  overrides the fill's reference point. Auto-detected as `0` for a bipolar
  range (`minimum < 0 < maximum`) or the slider's own minimum for a
  unipolar one (Sharpness, Defringe, Luminance NR — these already start at
  their "no effect" value, so a left-anchored fill is correct there, not
  center-out). Temperature is neither: it's absolute Kelvin (2000-12000),
  so `0` isn't in range and isn't meaningful — its center is set to the
  **as-shot temperature** instead (`_as_shot_temperature`, already tracked
  per-file) and re-synced every time `set_adjustments()` loads a new file.
  This is a genuine improvement over the reference mockup, whose Temp
  slider is a simplified `-100..+100` relative offset rather than RAWviewer's
  real absolute-Kelvin-with-per-file-reference model.
- **Gradient hints**: `set_track_gradient()` draws a 3-stop `QLinearGradient`
  as the track background, underneath the solid accent fill — a dim,
  always-visible cue for direction (Temperature: muted blue → orange;
  Tint: muted green → magenta), verified against `_apply_wb_tint`'s actual
  sign convention (positive Temperature = warmer/more red, positive Tint =
  more magenta) so the gradient direction matches what the slider actually
  does, not just what looks plausible. HSL's 8 sliders would be a natural
  next candidate for per-color gradients, deferred since that section is
  still hidden behind `_SHOW_HSL_UI = False` (see below) — no point styling
  controls nobody can see yet.
- **Verified**: headless-Qt screenshots at each step (isolated slider
  gallery covering bipolar-positive/negative/zero, unipolar, and the
  Temperature center+gradient case; then the full panel in context) confirm
  the fill direction, magnitude, and gradient all render correctly. A
  direct `QTest` press/move/release drag test confirms hit-testing is
  unaffected — dragging to the same on-screen position yields the same
  value as before (cross-checked against a plain, unmodified `QSlider` to
  confirm the single-click "page-step, not jump-to-position" behavior is
  pre-existing native Qt/style behavior, not something this change
  introduced). Value-label click-to-reset, Reset-all, and
  `get_adjustments()`/`set_adjustments()` round-tripping (including the
  dynamic Temperature center) all re-verified working.
- **Deliberately not pulled from the reference**: floating pill buttons
  (Before/After, Reset All, Export) over the canvas instead of inside the
  panel — the user's call was to keep Reset/Export in the panel (where they
  already are) and consider a keyboard shortcut for compare instead of a
  floating toggle, rather than adopting the mockup's canvas-overlay layout,
  which would also compete with the Compare toggle already built into the
  panel header this session.

### HSL / Color Mixer

Eight colors: **Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Aqua, Blue, Purple, Magenta**.

| Per color | XMP keys | Range |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Hue | `HueAdjustment{Color}` | −100 … +100 |
| Saturation | `SaturationAdjustment{Color}` | −100 … +100 |
| Luminance | `LuminanceAdjustment{Color}` | −100 … +100 |

UI: color dropdown + three sliders; per-color values cached when switching colors.
`_SHOW_HSL_UI = True`. Float32 HSV scale bug (Performance review #6) is **fixed** —
H is degrees [0,360], S/V are [0,1]; sliders behave proportionally.

### Creative LUT

| Control | XMP key | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| LUT basename | `CreativeLUTName` | Managed file under app-support `luts/` |
| Strength | `CreativeLUTAmount` | 0–100; 0 = off |

Drag-drop / Add / Remove / None in the Adjust **Creative LUT** section. Applied in
the display color stage after vignette/dehaze (`raw_lut.py`).

### Detail

| Control | XMP key | Range | Pipeline stage |
|---------|---------|-------|----------------|
| Sharpness | `Sharpness` | 0 … 150 | Display-linear unsharp |
| Clarity | `Clarity2012` | −100 … +100 | Local contrast (display-linear) |
| Defringe | `Defringe` | 0 … 100 | Purple/green fringe reduction, edge-gated (see Performance review #8) |

### Noise

| Control | XMP key | Range | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| Luma NR | `LuminanceNoiseReduction` | 0 … 100 | Bilateral filter on Y only; chroma untouched |
| Chroma NR method | `DenoiseMethod` | Off / Bilateral / Guided | Combo in Detail section |
| Chroma Amount | `ColorNoiseReduction` | 0 … 100 | Strength when a method is selected (UI default 50) |

Both use an edge-aware bilateral filter directly on float32 (`raw_chroma_denoise.py`)
— no NLM, no uint8 quantization step. Luma NR uses a gentler sigmaColor range
(0.015-0.065) than Chroma NR (0.03-0.15) since luminance carries real image
detail; both keep hard edges sharp regardless of strength (bilateral filter is
edge-aware by construction — see Performance review #11/#12).

Preview: Chroma NR when method ≠ Off and amount > 0. Export: same, or
`RAWVIEWER_EDIT_CHROMA_DENOISE=1`. Luma NR applies whenever its slider is
non-zero, in both preview and export (same as any other slider, no separate
env-var force-on path).

### Effects / Local

| Control | XMP key | Range | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|
| Vignette | `PostCropVignetteAmount` | −100 … +100 | LR sign: negative darkens corners, positive lightens. **Paint Overlay** (lerp toward black/white), not stops/`exp2` |
| Midpoint | `PostCropVignetteMidpoint` | 0 … 100 (default 50) | Corner-normalized radius: lower = larger falloff (toward center); higher = packed at corners |
| Dehaze | `Dehaze` | −100 … +100 | Whole-frame; display-linear |
| Dodge/Burn Effect Strength | `DodgeBurnStrength` | 0.50 … 3.00 stops | Stops at full mask; Brush Flow is paint-only; alone without a mask is still “default” for Reset |
| Dodge/Burn mask | `crs:DodgeBurnMask` | base64 PNG | Custom element |

Vignette/dehaze always run on the **full preview frame** (banded display must not re-center the radial map per row band).

### Recovery baseline (legacy flag)

| Control | Internal key | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Use recovery look | `_recovery_baseline` | **UI removed (2026-07)**; still honored if present in a session dict. Not written to XMP. |

When enabled (programmatic / legacy session):

- Skips PV2012 tone; uses P-key recovery tone map + local shadow/highlight recovery.
- **Highlights / Shadows sliders** move to hint readouts (`+40` / `−35`) so the panel reflects recovery; hints do not disable recovery tone.
- Moving **Contrast**, **Whites**, **Blacks**, or parametric tone controls clears recovery baseline.
- Moving **Highlights** or **Shadows** off the hints clears recovery and switches to PV2012 tone using the new values.
- **P** recovery preview is disabled while Adjust is open.
- Exposure / WB / Sat / Vibrance / Detail / HSL still apply on top of recovery tone.

Constants: `RECOVERY_BASELINE_SHADOWS2012`, `RECOVERY_BASELINE_HIGHLIGHTS2012` in `raw_adjustments.py`.

---

## UI (`rawviewer_ui/adjust_panel.py`)

- Floating panel (**E**), draggable card, scrollable content
- Sliders: immediate value readout in **blue** (`#90CAF9`); **80 ms** throttled preview; XMP on release
- Click value label → reset single slider; **Reset** → all defaults + as-shot Temp
- **Tone curve** graph + R/G/B channels + PV Shad/Dark/Light/High (`_SHOW_TONE_CURVE_UI = True`)
- **HSL** section — visible (`_SHOW_HSL_UI = True`)
- **Chroma NR** method combo + Amount slider
- **Vignette / Midpoint / Dehaze** sliders in Detail
- **Dodge & Burn** Local tools + Brush Size/Flow + Effect Strength (stops)
- **Creative LUT** + **XMP presets** managed libraries (drag-drop / apply / remove)
- **Lens correction** toggle — hidden unless a matching profile is found for the current file
- Recovery look button — **removed** from UI (pipeline flag still honored if set)
- **Compare** toggle (header, split-view icon) — see Compare with original
- **Export…** menu (see below)
- Sliders / buttons use `NoFocus` so app shortcuts keep working

> `apply_adjustments_to_rgb` (uint8 browse/export helpers) now always routes
> through the scene-linear pipeline (sRGB EOTF → process → encode), matching
> the Adjust panel. The legacy gamma-space core remains only for internal
> banded detail-enhance unit tests.

### Adjust zoom vs live-drag tiers

While Adjust is open, **100% zoom is relative to the edit buffer** (typically
half-res settle, e.g. ~3500px long edge), not a browse-path sensor decode.

| Mode | Live-drag (`full_quality=False`) | Settle / zoom-in |
|------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Fit | May paint **640px** lite (`_ADJUST_FAST_PREVIEW_MAX_EDGE`) | Half-res settle replaces lite |
| 100% (zoomed) | Lite paints are **deferred** so they cannot replace the sharper buffer | Restore `_adjust_hires_render` before zoom; request `full_quality=True` |

Double-click / Space while Adjust is open **do not** queue
`_queue_sensor_full_decode` (browse full-res). See Performance review #27.

---

## Export formats

| Menu option | Output | Use case |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| 16-bit TIFF (baked) | Full-res AHD + pipeline + optional embedded XMP | Archival / print |
| JPEG (baked) | 8-bit sRGB, Q=92 | Sharing |
| WebP (baked) | 8-bit sRGB, Q=88 | Sharing |

**Removed (2026-07-04):** "DNG — copy RAW + XMP settings" and "DNG — baked
16-bit RGB" were both removed from the export menu — a user reported the
baked-RGB DNG file could not be opened at all. The RGB-container-DNG approach
(a plain RGB TIFF with `DNGVersion`/`UniqueCameraModel` tags bolted on, no
real sensor mosaic/CFA data) was never a real DNG as far as most DNG readers
are concerned; fixing the Pillow crash that blocked it (Performance review
#13) made it *write* successfully but did not make the result *openable*.
Rather than ship a format that produces unopenable files, both DNG options
were dropped. `export_adjusted_dng_rgb`, `export_raw_with_xmp_settings`,
`EXPORT_FORMAT_DNG_RGB`, and `EXPORT_FORMAT_DNG_SETTINGS` no longer exist in
`raw_edit_pipeline.py`. If DNG output is revisited later, it needs a real DNG
writer (e.g. a proper CFA/mosaic + DNG tag set), not this shortcut.

16-bit TIFF writes via **`tifffile`** (`_write_16bit_rgb_tiff` in
`raw_edit_pipeline.py`), not Pillow — Pillow's `"RGB"` mode is defined as
8-bit-per-channel with no 16-bit 3-channel mode at all, so
`Image.fromarray(uint16_array, mode="RGB")` has no valid type-lookup entry
(crashes on newer Pillow; silently truncates to 8-bit via any raw-mode
workaround on older Pillow — see Performance review #13). Compression is
`deflate` (not LZW): LZW requires the separate `imagecodecs` package, which
isn't a project dependency. XMP (tag 700) is written via `extratags`.

Export always writes XMP to the **source** file first (best-effort). The
source-sidecar write cannot fail the export: if it can't be written (e.g. the
source is on read-only media), the requested export to `output_path` still
proceeds, and no (potentially stale) XMP is embedded in the baked TIFF output.

---

## XMP sidecar

Written on slider / curve release and before export:

- `crs:ProcessVersion` = `11.0`
- `crs:ToneCurveName2012` = `Linear`
- All keys in the table above (non-default values only)
- `crs:ToneCurvePV2012` point list when curve is non-linear
- `DefringePurpleAmount` / `DefringeGreenAmount` when Defringe > 0

**Important:** `write_xmp_adjustments()` **rewrites** the sidecar with supported global fields only. Lightroom **masks / local adjustments** are lost — back up `.xmp` before saving from RAWviewer.

---

## Verification checklist

1. Open RAW → **E** → wait for edit base (linear demosaic, not embedded JPEG)
2. Drag **Exposure** / **Shadows** — PV2012 tone, not gamma add
3. (Legacy) If `_recovery_baseline` is set programmatically — Shadows/Highlights readouts jump to +40/−35; preview matches recovery tone
4. **Saturation** / **Vibrance** — consistent "pop" across hues (red, green, blue, skin tones); no hard clipping to a flat fully-saturated color on any one hue
5. **Sharpness** / **Clarity** — no black frame; image stays visible
6. **Export…** — TIFF / JPEG / WebP options
7. Shortcuts (**P**, **J**, arrows, etc.) work with Adjust panel open
8. **WB dropper icon** (end of Temperature row) — click, click a neutral gray/white
   area — Temperature/Tint update and the area turns neutral; Esc cancels an armed
   pick without sampling
9. Save an edit, switch to gallery — the edited file's tile shows the pencil badge
   (top-right corner); tile pixels stay the unedited thumbnail (see Gallery integration)
10. **Defringe** on a purple/green fringed edge (e.g. a backlit branch) — halo shrinks;
    a solid purple/green subject elsewhere in frame (flower, foliage) is not desaturated
11. **Blacks** right (+) lifts/lightens shadows, left (−) crushes them; **Whites** right (+)
    brightens/pushes highlights toward clipping, left (−) recovers them — not the reverse
12. **Shadows** past ~50 on a smooth dark gradient (e.g. a soft shadow falloff) — no
    banding/reversed local contrast in the shadow region
13. **Adjust zoom:** settle half-res → Fit drag (status may show 640) → double-click 100% —
    status restores ~half-res dimensions (not stuck at 640×427); further slider drags must
    not drop the zoomed buffer to lite
14. **Chroma NR** method + Amount on a neutral gray/white subject (e.g. a gray card, overcast
    sky) — no green tint after enabling
15. **Luma NR** slider on a noisy high-ISO shot — grain visibly reduces; hard edges
    (e.g. a horizon line) stay sharp, no smearing
16. **Export…** — every remaining format (TIFF16, JPEG, WebP) completes without
    error; open the 16-bit TIFF in another app and confirm it's genuinely
    16-bit (not silently 8-bit)
17. **Tone curve** — drag a point on the graph, and PV Shad/Dark/Light/High
    past ~50 in either direction — no banding/reversed local contrast anywhere
    on the curve
18. `PYTHONPATH=src python3 scripts/phase_develop_adjust_linear.py`
19. **Compare** toggle (panel header, split-view icon) — split view appears with
    original on the left, edited on the right; drag the divider anywhere across
    the image and it tracks the cursor; adjust a slider while comparing — only
    the edited (right) side updates; toggle off — split view disappears cleanly
20. **Lens correction** toggle — hidden on a file with no matching lens profile
    (check with an unusual/manual lens); shown on a file with a recognized
    camera+lens; toggling on visibly corrects barrel/pincushion distortion and
    re-decodes (brief status message); exported file reflects the same toggle
    state as the preview
21. `PYTHONPATH=src pixi run python3 scripts/phase_develop_adjust_linear.py`
    (run via pixi specifically — the lens-correction tests need `lensfunpy`)
22. Drag a bipolar slider (e.g. **Exposure**) both directions — fill grows
    from the center, not the left edge; at exactly the default value, no
    fill shows at all. Drag a unipolar slider (**Sharpness**) — fill grows
    from the left edge as usual. Drag **Temp** — background shows a dim
    blue→orange gradient, fill starts from the as-shot value (not the
    slider's numeric midpoint), and the reference point moves if you switch
    to a file with a different as-shot temperature
23. **WB dropper button** — click it while the panel is scrolled to any
    position; it should toggle (icon highlights, status bar shows the
    "click a neutral area" message, cursor becomes a crosshair) every time,
    not just when the button happens to be positioned somewhere specific
24. Drag **Contrast** (or **Highlights**/**Shadows**/**Whites**/**Blacks**/the
    tone curve) on a large RAW file — the preview should visibly track the
    cursor smoothly while dragging (briefly softer detail is expected), then
    snap to full sharpness within roughly a second of releasing

HSL UI is on (`_SHOW_HSL_UI = True`); treat results as experimental until any
remaining colorspace-scale issues are closed (see Performance review #6).

---

## Known limitations / future work

See also the ranked table in [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](../RELEASE_NOTES.md) (v3.0).

- HSL UI is visible; treat results as experimental until any remaining
  colorspace-scale issues are closed (Performance review #6)
- Channel tone curves (R/G/B tabs) exist in UI; treat parity with Lightroom as ongoing
- Dodge/burn + interactive crop ship; broader masks (gradient / radial / ML subject)
  remain future work
- Recovery baseline is preview-session UI state, not persisted in XMP
- No DNG export (removed 2026-07-04; see Export formats) — no non-destructive
  RAW+XMP round-trip or RGB-DNG output until a real DNG writer is built
- Browse / gallery **default** to original pixels (`RAWVIEWER_SIDECAR_ADJUST=0`);
  saved XMP edits render in the Adjust panel. Opt in with
  `RAWVIEWER_SIDECAR_ADJUST=1` (progressive full apply — see Performance review #25).
  Gallery tiles still show an edited **badge**, not regenerated edited pixels, by default.

---

## Gallery / cache integration (2026-07-03)

**Background (updated 2026-07-16):** browse surfaces default to **original**
pixels (`sidecar_adjustments_enabled()` is off unless
`RAWVIEWER_SIDECAR_ADJUST=1`). When sidecar apply is opted in, CURRENT full-tier
loads use `apply_sidecar_progressive()` (preview-sized interim, then full
memoized apply); PRELOAD/BACKGROUND still skip sidecar so neighbors cannot
monopolize the worker pool. The gallery grid still does not re-render tile
pixels through the adjust pipeline by default — see the badge section below.

### Implemented now: lightweight "edited" badge (no pixel re-render)

A small pencil badge (top-right corner of the tile, mirroring the existing
bottom-right bookmark star / top-left burst-count badges) shows on any gallery
tile whose file has a saved XMP sidecar — the thumbnail pixels themselves are
**not** re-rendered through the adjust pipeline.

- `rawviewer_ui/widgets.py` (`ThumbnailLabel`): `_gallery_edited` flag,
  `set_gallery_edited()`, `_update_edited_badge()` / `_position_edited_badge()` —
  copied from the existing `_bookmark_badge` trio, same mechanism (child `QLabel`,
  absolute-positioned, shown/hidden, repositioned in `resizeEvent`).
- `rawviewer_ui/gallery_view.py` (`JustifiedGallery`): `refresh_gallery_edited_visuals()`
  mirrors `refresh_gallery_bookmark_visuals()`; also set at tile-build time
  alongside the existing bookmark/burst badge calls.
- `main.py`: `_is_gallery_path_edited(file_path)` — the state lookup backing the
  badge. Deliberately **not** a full `load_adjustments_for_file()` +
  `is_default_adjustments()` parse (that does EXIF/rawpy calls to resolve
  as-shot temperature — too heavy to run per visible tile). Instead it checks
  whether the `.xmp` sidecar file exists at all
  (`raw_adjustments.resolve_xmp_path` + `os.path.isfile`), which is an exact,
  filesystem-cheap proxy: `write_xmp_adjustments()` already **deletes** the
  sidecar when settings return to default (`raw_adjustments.py`), so existence
  alone means "non-default adjustments saved" — no parsing needed for a hint-only
  badge. `_on_adjust_panel_editing_finished` calls
  `_refresh_gallery_bookmark_visuals()` (now also refreshes the edited badge)
  right after the XMP write, so the badge updates immediately without needing a
  folder reload.
- Caveat: a foreign, non-RAWviewer XMP sidecar with no `crs:` adjustment keys
  (e.g. keywords-only XMP from another tool) would also light the badge — a rare
  false positive acceptable for a hint-only indicator.

### Deferred for future reference: regenerating the actual edited thumbnail pixels

**Shipped path (2026-07, preferred):** on Adjust save
(`_on_adjust_panel_editing_finished`), after cache invalidate, bake the
just-rendered editor frame (`_adjust_last_render`) into thumbnail / grid /
preview tiers via `_persist_editor_aligned_browse_caches`. Cost is resize +
JPEG encode only (~5–30ms) — **not** part of Export, and **not** a full
linear-pipeline re-bake of the embedded JPEG (which diverged from Adjust).

**Hard rules:**
- RAW-only (`resolve_xmp_path` / badge / bake all gate on `is_raw_file`) so a
  companion JPEG sharing the RAW basename never receives the RAW's XMP look.
- Keep `RAWVIEWER_SIDECAR_ADJUST=0` / `RAWVIEWER_EDITED_PREVIEWS=0` as default
  so cold gallery scroll does not pay per-tile pipeline cost.

**Still open if wanted later:** cold folders that never visited Adjust still
show embedded JPEG until the next save (or until an optional
`SIDECAR_ADJUST`/edited-preview opt-in path regenerates tiles). The older
sketch below remains valid for that opt-in:

1. **Invalidate, don't restructure.** On XMP save
   (`_on_adjust_panel_editing_finished`, `main.py`, and the export worker's
   `write_xmp_adjustments_for_file` call) call `image_cache.invalidate_file()`
   for the `thumbnail`/`grid`/`preview` tiers only — leave the `full_image` tier
   alone, since `process_full_image()` already re-applies the sidecar on every
   read of that tier regardless of caching.
2. **Make thumbnail generation sidecar-aware, but only pay for it when needed.**
   `UnifiedImageProcessor.process_thumbnail()`
   (`unified_image_processor.py`) currently never calls
   `_apply_sidecar_if_needed()`. Add the same call `process_full_image()` already
   makes, gated by the existing `is_default_adjustments()` early-exit inside
   `_apply_sidecar_if_needed()` — so files with no saved adjustments (the
   overwhelming majority) take exactly the same code path as today, and only
   files with a non-default XMP sidecar pay the extra cost of running the linear
   pipeline during thumbnail extraction.
3. **Trigger a refresh, not a rebuild.** After step 1's invalidation, call
   something like `gallery_justified.request_thumbnail_refresh(file_path)` (new,
   or reuse the existing `thumbnail_ready` signal path via
   `image_load_manager`) so only the affected tile re-requests its thumbnail —
   the pooled/visible-widget model already used for
   `refresh_gallery_*_visuals()` means this does not require rebuilding the grid.
4. **Cost/risk to flag before building this:** thumbnail generation for edited
   files becomes measurably slower (full linear pipeline vs. a JPEG/half-size
   decode) — acceptable since it is one-time-until-next-edit and scoped to a
   small subset of files, but should be verified against a folder with many
   edited RAWs before shipping, to make sure regenerating dozens of edited
   thumbnails at once (e.g. after a batch XMP edit) doesn't stall the gallery
   thread pool. The editor-bake path above avoids this cost on the common
   save-from-Adjust workflow.
5. **Filmstrip/preload** (`_PRELOAD_NEXT_COUNT`/`_PRELOAD_PREV_COUNT`,
   `main.py`) only prefetches `{"thumbnail","exif"}` for normal navigation
   (sidecar-unaware) and `{"exif","full"}` (sidecar-aware) only once zoomed to
   100% — would need the same treatment as step 2 if this is built, or the
   filmstrip will show stale previews even after the gallery grid is fixed.

## Performance review (2026-07-03)

Benchmarked on a synthetic 2000×3000 buffer (representative of a half-size decode
of a ~24 MP sensor — the live "E" preview size). The **80 ms preview throttle**
documented above is a scheduling debounce, not the actual per-tick compute cost;
real latency is dominated by full-frame numpy passes with no incremental
recompute.

| # | Finding | Measured | Status |
|---|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | `_encode_srgb8` / `linear_to_export_uint16_srgb` used `np.where(...,  np.power(x, 1/2.4), ...)` over the whole frame — `np.power` dominated cost even though `raw_pv2012.py` already proved the LUT pattern works for the base curve | Encode alone: **~170–190ms**, ~70% of total no-op preview time | **Fixed** — nearest-index LUT (4096 entries, 8-bit; 65536, 16-bit) in `raw_tone_recovery.py` (`_encode_srgb8` / `_encode_srgb16`); ~65–70ms, 2.6–2.8× faster, <1 LSB error |
| 2 | No incremental recompute — every slider tick reruns the entire WB→exposure→NLM→PV2012→tonemap→sat→HSL→detail chain even when only one late-stage control changed | All-default preview ~150–270ms; typical multi-slider edit ~1.7–1.9s; far past the 80ms throttle window | **Fixed** — see Performance review #18 (`PreviewStageCache`, live preview path only) |
| 3 | Recovery baseline (`_tone_map_recovery_display`) reruns a `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter(sigma=22)` + downsample/upsample round-trip on every tick, even though Exposure/Sat/Vibrance/HSL/Detail are layered "on top of" recovery tone and don't need it recomputed | ~2.0–2.3s per tick with recovery on, the slowest path measured | **Partially fixed** — see Performance review #18; the gaussian-filter pass is now skipped when only a sat/vibrance/HSL/detail slider changes with recovery held on, since it lives in the cached tonemap stage, but still reruns on any pre-tone or PV2012-tone-slider change |
| 4 | `UnifiedImageProcessor.decode_raw_edit_base(..., executor=self.process_pool)` accepts `executor` but never uses it — decode always runs in-process on the calling `QRunnable` thread, not offloaded to the process pool | N/A (code review) | **Fixed (2026-07-16)** — rawpy/AHD fallback submits via `executor.submit(decode_raw_file, ...)` when a process pool is present (Windows/Linux default); macOS usually has `executor=None` (pool off). Fast path still in-process. |
| 5 | `phase_develop_adjust_linear.py` only checks correctness on tiny (16×16–64×64) synthetic arrays; no benchmark at realistic preview resolution | N/A | Open — a perf regression (like #1) would not be caught by the existing suite |
| 6 | `raw_hsl.py`'s `_rgb_to_hsv` treats cv2's **float32** `COLOR_BGR2HSV` output (already H:0–360, S/V:0–1) as if it were the **uint8** convention (H:0–179, S/V:0–255) — `h * 2.0` doubles an already-0–360 hue (wraps/misassigns color bands), and `s / 255.0`, `v / 255.0` crush saturation/value to ~1/255 of true scale. `_hsv_to_rgb`'s uint8 packing then largely undoes the S/V crush on the way back out, but the per-color slider deltas (`ds`/`dv`, order ±1.0) are added *before* that undo, so they dominate the crushed (~0.004) true value — HSL Hue/Sat/Lum sliders would behave close to on/off rather than proportional, and hue-band assignment is wrong. Not visible while `_SHOW_HSL_UI = False`, but still runs for any file with pre-existing non-zero `HueAdjustment*`/`SaturationAdjustment*`/`LuminanceAdjustment*` XMP values (browse view, export) | Confirmed via direct `cv2.cvtColor` test; not benchmarked (no user-visible path while hidden) | **Fixed** — float path uses H∈[0,360], S/V∈[0,1]; defensive uint8-scale detection retained; `t_hsl_correctness.py` guards proportional sat + hue shift |
| 7 | `_apply_saturation_vibrance` scaled chroma (`img - luma`) additively on **scene-linear** RGB with no upper clip. Linear-light channel spread is highly hue-dependent (green/yellow have large spread relative to luma, red/blue less so), so the same `+50` slider value clipped green/yellow to a flat, fully-saturated block (`ΔS` up to 0.54, hitting the gamut ceiling) while skin tones and blue sky barely moved (`ΔS` ~0.11–0.13) — the reported "colors look off, no pop" | Measured `ΔS` (HSV saturation, encoded output) across 6 test hues at Saturation +50: **0.11–0.54** (7× spread, several hues clipped to `S=1.0`) | **Fixed** — `_apply_saturation_vibrance` now round-trips scene-linear → sRGB-encoded (float LUT, `_encode_srgb_float01`/`_decode_srgb_float01` in `raw_tone_recovery.py`) and scales the HSV **S** channel there, bounded to `[0, 1]` by construction. Same 6 hues at +50 now measure **0.13–0.30** (~2× spread, no clipping). Cost: +~50–80ms per preview tick when Saturation/Vibrance is non-zero (HSV round-trip); no-op path unaffected |
| 8 | `apply_defringe` (`raw_detail_enhance.py`) had no edge/locality gate at all — any pixel whose hue leaned purple/green relative to its own chroma got desaturated, including uniform, unfringed regions, because `fringe / span` is scale-invariant along the purple/green hue axis rather than proportional to cast strength. A uniform purple patch (e.g. a flower petal, no edge anywhere) lost **90% saturation at Defringe=100** with nothing to correct. Separately, `green = g - 0.5*(r+b)` had half the gain of `purple = r+b-2*g` for the same absolute color imbalance — green fringing was flagged as half as severe as equally-strong purple fringing | Uniform purple patch: **90% saturation loss** at Defringe=100 with zero edges present; purple-vs-green raw mask ratio confirmed **exactly 2.00×** at every tested magnitude (d=0.02/0.05/0.10) | **Fixed** — `green` now uses `2*g - r - b` (exact negation of `purple`, so `fringe == \|r + b - 2*g\|`); added `edge_weight` gated on local luminance contrast (same Gaussian-blur trick as clarity/sharpness, sigma=1.5, soft-knee `edge/(edge+0.04)`) so the mask only engages near a real luminance transition. Uniform purple/green patches now measure **0% saturation loss** at Defringe=100; a genuine fringe pixel at a dark/bright edge still loses ~57-75%. 3 new smoke tests added (`test_defringe_*`) |
| 9 | `raw_pv2012._apply_whites_blacks` had Whites/Blacks **sign-inverted**: `white_pt = 1.0 + w*0.12` / `black_pt = b*0.12` made Blacks+100 *crush* shadows and Whites+100 *darken* highlights — backwards from every reference tool and from this app's own legacy gamma-space implementation of the same named controls, which get the direction right. Affects 100% of PV2012 Whites/Blacks usage, not an edge case | End-to-end test on a shadow/highlight ramp: `Blacks=+100` darkened 0.02→0.01 (should lighten); `Blacks=-100` lightened 0.02→0.060 (should darken); `Whites=+100` darkened 0.9→0.804 (should brighten); legacy path's own Blacks/Whites confirmed correct-direction on the identical test | **Fixed** — signs flipped: `white_pt = 1.0 - w*0.12`, `black_pt = -b*0.12`. Re-verified same ramp now moves in the expected direction both ways |
| 10 | `raw_pv2012._apply_highlights_shadows`'s shadow-lift branch (`Shadows2012 > 0`) used coefficient 0.42, but the shadow-region weight's slope reaches ~5.85 at y≈0.11 — any coefficient above ~0.17 makes the combined tone curve **locally decreasing** (a real, visible banding/contrast-reversal defect, not just theoretical). First appeared between Shadows=40 and 50. The Recovery-baseline preset hint (`Shadows=+40`) happened to sit just under the threshold; any user manually pushing Shadows past ~45 hit it. `raw_adjustments.py`'s legacy gamma-space duplicate (`_apply_highlights_shadows`/`_apply_masked_luminance_adjust`, still reachable for non-RAW/uint8 images) had the same class of bug and broke even earlier — Shadows=15 already showed violations — because its coefficient (0.55) is shared across three different region-weight shapes (shadow/black/highlight) of very different steepness (worst slopes -12.36 / -29.57 / -1.0 respectively) | PV2012: 50/1999 backward steps at Shadows=100, worst -0.0069, monotonicity break confirmed to start ~Shadows 40-50 (matches the derivative-based safe-coefficient calc `0.17/0.42×100≈40` exactly). Legacy: up to 596/3999 backward steps at Shadows=100, breaking as early as Shadows=15 (7 bad steps) | **Fixed** — PV2012 coefficient reduced 0.42→0.15 (safe margin under the computed 0.17 ceiling); re-verified monotonic at Shadows=100 and at all-sliders-maxed combos. Legacy: `_apply_masked_luminance_adjust` gained a `lift_up_strength` parameter (previously one hardcoded 0.55 shared by all three masks) so Shadow (0.07), Black (0.03), and Highlight/White (default 0.55, already safe) each get a coefficient sized to their own region-weight steepness rather than one value forced down to the strictest case. Re-verified monotonic for both Shadows and Blacks up to their extremes. 4 new smoke tests added (`test_pv2012_shadows_lift_stays_monotonic`, `test_pv2012_whites_blacks_sign_direction`, `test_legacy_gamma_highlights_shadows_stays_monotonic`, `test_legacy_gamma_blacks_stays_monotonic`) |

| 11 | `raw_chroma_denoise.apply_chroma_nlm` (superseded by `apply_chroma_denoise`, see #12) converted Cb/Cr from float to uint8 via a bare `.astype(np.uint8)`, which **truncates toward zero** rather than rounding. Cb/Cr fractional parts are effectively uniformly distributed, so truncation biases both channels ~-0.5 LSB (≈-0.00196 in [0,1]) low on average -- not randomly, systematically, every pixel, every call. The YCbCr→RGB inverse (`R = Y + 1.5748·Cr0`, `G = Y - 0.1873·Cb0 - 0.4681·Cr0`, `B = Y + 1.8556·Cb0`) turns a uniform negative bias in *both* Cb and Cr into less R, less B, and **more G** — a systematic green cast on every image that goes through Chroma NR, reported by a user as "casts a green shade" | Reproduced the bias in isolation (quantize/dequantize Cb+Cr with **zero** actual NLM denoising applied): mean RGB delta on a neutral-gray test image = `[-0.00308, +0.00128, -0.00363]`, reproducible to 4 decimal places across 15 random-noise seeds (not noise-dependent). Matches the predicted truncation bias (`-0.5/255 = -0.00196`) driven through the same inverse-transform coefficients almost exactly | **Fixed** (then superseded) — added `+ 0.5` before both `.astype(np.uint8)` casts (round-to-nearest, matching the pattern already used in the sRGB encode LUTs from finding #1). Re-verified: residual mean RGB delta dropped to ~1e-5–2e-4. Superseded by #12, which removes the uint8 round-trip entirely |
| 12 | Follow-up to a "is there a better NR than chroma NR" question: (a) chroma NR used NLM (`cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising`), one of the more expensive denoise algorithms, on a full preview/export buffer; (b) there was no luminance noise reduction at all — only Cb/Cr were ever touched, so grainy high-ISO detail noise went untreated | Benchmarked NLM vs. bilateral filter (`cv2.bilateralFilter`, applied directly on float32, no uint8 step) at realistic sizes: **19-22× faster** (1200×1800: 232ms→12ms; 2500×3750: 1105ms→50ms per channel). Bilateral also verified edge-preserving: a hard color-edge transition stays 0px wide even at max strength, while a flat noisy region's std-dev drops 71-81% depending on sigmaColor | **Implemented** — `apply_chroma_nlm` replaced with `apply_chroma_denoise` (bilateral, sigmaColor 0.03-0.15, no uint8 round-trip — also eliminates the whole bug class from #11 structurally, not just patched). Added `apply_luma_denoise` (bilateral on Y only, gentler sigmaColor 0.015-0.065 since luminance carries real detail unlike chroma) with a new **Luma NR** slider (`LuminanceNoiseReduction`, 0-100, `adjust_panel.py`/XMP) sitting above the existing Chroma NR toggle under a new "Noise" section. 6 new smoke tests added covering noise reduction, edge preservation, and pipeline wiring for both filters |

| 13 | Both 16-bit TIFF and baked-DNG-RGB export crashed outright: `Image.fromarray(out, mode="RGB")` with a uint16 3-channel array has no valid entry in Pillow's `fromarray` type-lookup table, because Pillow's `"RGB"` mode is *defined* as 8-bit-per-channel -- there is no Pillow mode for 16-bit 3-channel data at all, on any version. `pixi.toml` pinned `Pillow = ">=10.0.0"` with no upper bound, so whichever Pillow version an environment resolves determines whether this crashes (newer Pillow, confirmed on 12.2.0) or "succeeds" while silently discarding the low byte on every channel (older Pillow / any raw-mode workaround) -- reported by a user as "export failed" | Reproduced with `export_adjusted_tiff16`/`export_adjusted_dng_rgb` on synthetic data: `TypeError: Cannot handle this data type: (1, 1, 3), <u2` (that shape is Pillow's internal lookup-key shorthand, not the actual array shape -- verified the real array was a normal `(200, 300, 3)` right up to the failing call by tracing into Pillow's own `fromarray` source). Separately, JPEG export crashed too: `subsampling=0` + `optimize=True` together triggered a libjpeg "Suspension not allowed here" encoder error, reproduced with a plain synthetic uint8 array and zero RAWViewer-specific code -- either flag alone works | **Fixed, then DNG-RGB removed entirely (2026-07-04)** -- 16-bit TIFF now writes via `tifffile` (`_write_16bit_rgb_tiff`), bypassing Pillow's Image model entirely; `tifffile` added as a project dependency (`pixi.toml`/`pixi.lock`). Compression is `deflate`, not LZW (LZW needs the separate `imagecodecs` package, not a project dependency). XMP (tag 700) moves to `extratags`. Verified true 16-bit output (values >255 present, not silently 8-bit). JPEG export drops `optimize=True` (pure file-size optimization, no visible quality loss) and keeps `subsampling=0` (matters for color fidelity). Baked-DNG-RGB got the same tifffile fix and stopped crashing, but a user then reported the resulting file couldn't be opened at all -- the RGB-container-DNG approach (plain RGB TIFF + `DNGVersion`/`UniqueCameraModel` tags, no real CFA/mosaic data) was never a real DNG to begin with, fixing the crash didn't fix that. Both DNG export options ("copy RAW + XMP settings" and "baked 16-bit RGB") were removed rather than shipping an unopenable format -- see Export formats. 4 new smoke tests added for the surviving formats |

| 14 | Re-enabling the hidden tone curve UI surfaced a monotonicity bug in `apply_parametric_tone_curve` (`raw_tone_curve.py`) before it ever shipped visibly: `ParametricShadows` +100 and `ParametricHighlights` -100 both made the combined curve locally decreasing (banding), for the identical reason as the `raw_pv2012.py` shadow-lift bug fixed earlier in this doc -- the shadows/highlights region masks use the same `_smooth_weight`/`_SPLIT_SHADOWS=0.25` shape, so the same steep-slope-at-the-domain-boundary problem applies, just in a different function that happened to also use an unsafe coefficient (0.35) | Confirmed via the same derivative analysis as the earlier PV2012 fix: shadows-lift and highlights-darken brackets both reach worst slope ~5.89-5.90, requiring coefficient ≤~0.17; 0.35 produced real backward steps (worst -0.000052 at 20k-sample resolution, confirmed non-float32-noise via a 400k-sample float64 re-check showing `d(out)/dy` actually goes to -1.06 at the worst point) | **Fixed** -- coefficient reduced 0.35→0.15 (same value used for the analogous `raw_pv2012.py` fix), matching the identical safety margin. Re-verified monotonic for all 4 regions × both directions × combinations, standalone and composed with the rest of the PV2012 pipeline (Contrast/Highlights/Shadows/Whites/Blacks all maxed simultaneously). `_SHOW_TONE_CURVE_UI` then flipped to `True`. 1 new smoke test added (`test_parametric_tone_curve_stays_monotonic`) |

| 15 | User-reported "the tone curve is unresponsive" right after re-enabling it. Traced the whole chain (widget mouse events -> `get_adjustments()` -> XMP -> pipeline) and every step worked correctly in isolation -- the actual bug was a math error in `apply_pv2012_tone_rgb` (`raw_pv2012.py`): `y0` (meant to be the true pre-curve baseline) got reassigned to the curve-adjusted value (`y0 = apply_tone_curve_perceptual(y0, adj)`), and the final hue-preserving ratio then divided by that *same already-curved* value (`ratio = y1 / y0`). With no PV2012 sliders active, `y1` and the reassigned `y0` end up numerically identical, so `ratio` is exactly 1.0 regardless of what the point curve or PV parametric sliders (Shad/Dark/Light/High) do -- the curve was fully wired end-to-end but its effect was mathematically cancelled out of the image. Note this bug could only manifest once the tone curve UI was reachable (today), and doesn't affect the main Shadows2012/Highlights2012/Whites2012/Blacks2012 sliders, which don't go through `apply_tone_curve_perceptual` at all | Confirmed step by step: `apply_tone_curve_perceptual` alone responded correctly to a test curve; `apply_pv2012_tone_rgb` (the real entry point) called with the identical curve produced byte-identical output to the default curve, both with `ParametricShadows` and with the point-curve serial | **Fixed** -- kept the true baseline in `y0`, moved the curve-adjusted value to a new `y_curve` variable used only to feed `_apply_pv2012_perceptual` and the shadow-lift chroma-damp region test; the ratio's denominator now correctly stays `y0`. Re-verified: point curve and `ParametricShadows` now visibly change `apply_pv2012_tone_rgb` output; existing Shadows2012 behavior unaffected (no regression, as expected since this path never touched it); monotonicity re-confirmed with a curve active, standalone and combined with maxed sliders. 1 new smoke test added (`test_tone_curve_affects_pv2012_tone_rgb_output`) exercising the real entry point, closing the gap that let this ship silently broken |

| 16 | Follow-up user report after the tone curve fix: "shadow/black/white/highlight performance is still questionable... when lifting the black/shadow, the light part also be affected... cannot recover as much highlight/shadow [as] other editing application[s]." Root cause was much bigger than any single slider: `apply_pv2012_tone_rgb`'s `ratio = y1 / np.maximum(y0, _PERCEPTUAL_LUM_FLOOR)` floored *only the denominator*. With every slider at default, `y1 == y0` exactly, so this should be a pure identity operation -- but for any pixel with true perceptual luminance below the 0.03 floor (real deep-shadow/black detail), the floored denominator no longer equals the numerator, silently darkening that pixel up to 50% with **zero user adjustment**, before any slider was ever touched. The same floor then fought against genuine Shadows2012/Blacks2012 recovery attempts in that exact tonal range (the floor doesn't move when a slider tries to lift the pixel out of it, capping how much recovery could show through), and made Highlights2012 incorrectly touch the deepest shadows too (any ratio computed through this formula for a sub-floor pixel was wrong, regardless of which slider produced `y1`) | Confirmed the baseline-identity violation directly: with all 5 PV2012 sliders at default, `scene-linear=0.005` (well within real shadow detail) produced ratio=0.5 (max darkening) and `scene-linear=0.01` produced ratio=0.88 -- not 1.0, despite zero user adjustment. `Highlights2012=-100` also produced ratio=0.5 at `scene-linear=0.005` before the fix, confirming the region leak; after the fix, ratio=1.0 there (correctly untouched) | **Fixed** -- floored both numerator and denominator (`np.maximum(y1, floor) / np.maximum(y0, floor)`), so the floor still prevents a near-zero-denominator blowup but no longer breaks the identity case. Re-verified: baseline is now exact identity (ratio=1.0) at every tested luminance from 0.0001 to 4.0; `Highlights2012=-100` no longer touches deep shadows; `Shadows2012`/`Blacks2012` recovery is now visibly stronger and reaches the full `_MIN_TONE_RATIO`/`_MAX_TONE_RATIO` range in deep shadows instead of being capped short by the floor mismatch; monotonicity re-confirmed for all sliders and combinations. 2 new smoke tests added (`test_pv2012_default_adjustments_are_true_identity`, `test_pv2012_highlights_slider_does_not_touch_deep_shadows`) |

| 17 | Follow-up to the #16 fix: with the baseline-identity bug gone, the user asked whether Whites/Blacks range could be strengthened further -- `_apply_whites_blacks`'s `white_pt = 1.0 - w*0.12` / `black_pt = -b*0.12` meant even `Whites=+100`/`Blacks=-100` (the sliders' hard extremes) only moved the white/black point by 12%, nowhere near enough to visibly clip highlights or crush shadows the way the equivalent controls do in other editing tools | Tested candidate coefficients (0.12/0.2/0.25/0.3/0.35) via the real `apply_pv2012_tone_rgb` entry point; 0.25 gives a worst-case combined span (`Whites=+100` and `Blacks=-100` together) of 0.5 -- still comfortably clear of a degenerate near-zero span -- while producing a clearly stronger, visibly-clipping effect at the extremes | **Fixed** -- coefficient increased 0.12→0.25 in both `white_pt`/`black_pt`. Re-verified: still a pure affine remap + clip, so monotonicity holds unconditionally (confirmed via full derivative sweep at `Whites=+100`, `Blacks=-100`, and the combined worst case, all `bad_steps=0`); through the real pipeline entry point, `Whites=+100` now boosts a bright pixel's ratio to ~1.33× (was ~1.03×) and `Blacks=-100` drops a dark pixel's ratio to the `_MIN_TONE_RATIO` floor (0.5×, was ~0.85×). 1 new smoke test added (`test_pv2012_whites_blacks_strength`) asserting the strengthened magnitude, guarding against silent regression back toward the old weak coefficient |

| 18 | Follow-up to the user's "sluggish/laggy while dragging" report (see #16's investigation): finding #2 above, still open at that point -- every preview tick reran the entire WB -> exposure -> denoise -> PV2012 tone -> tonemap -> sat/vibrance -> HSL -> detail chain from scratch, even when dragging a single late-stage slider (e.g. Sharpness) with everything upstream unchanged | Benchmarked at the documented 2000x3000 preview size: dragging **Sharpness** (last stage) with Exposure/Shadows/Saturation already set, uncached **933ms/tick** vs staged **170ms/tick** (**5.5x**). Dragging an upstream slider (Shadows2012 or Exposure2012, which invalidate everything downstream anyway) showed **0.99-1.00x** -- i.e. no caching overhead penalty when caching can't help | **Implemented** -- `PreviewStageCache` (`raw_edit_pipeline.py`) memoizes 4 checkpoints: pre-tone (WB/Tint/Exposure/denoise), PV2012 tone, tonemap-for-display, and color (sat/vibrance/HSL), with detail (sharpen/clarity/defringe) computed last from the cached color output. Each stage's cache key is `(upstream_stage_key, this_stage's_own_adjustment_keys)` -- chaining to the upstream key is what makes a change to, say, Exposure2012 correctly invalidate every stage after it even though Exposure2012 isn't one of that stage's own keys. Only wired into the live preview path (`_AdjustPreviewWorker` in `main.py`, via `render_adjust_preview_uint8`) -- export always calls the plain uncached functions directly, so a cache bug here could never corrupt a baked export. Cache lives on the main window (`self._adjust_preview_stage_cache`) and self-invalidates on file navigation via base-image identity (`cache.base_ref is not rgb_image`), needing no explicit reset wiring at each of the existing `_adjust_preview_base_rgb = None` call sites. Guarded by a `threading.Lock` since the cache is mutated from the `QThreadPool` worker thread. Two real bugs were caught by property tests before shipping: (1) the tone stage's key initially included only its own PV2012/curve keys, not the upstream pre-tone key, so changing Exposure2012 alone (no PV2012 slider touched) incorrectly reused a tone-stage output computed from the *old* pre-tone buffer; (2) the "adjustments are all default" fast path (which bypasses pre-tone/tone entirely and returns the raw linear buffer) never stamped a tone-stage cache key, so transitioning into or out of all-default state left a stale key in place and the downstream tonemap stage wrongly reused output computed from different pixel data. Both fixed and re-verified. 2 new smoke tests added: `test_preview_stage_cache_matches_full_recompute` (staged output byte-identical to the uncached reference across a 20-step sequence covering single-key drags, multi-key combinations, recovery-baseline toggling, HSL, a fully-loaded combination, repeated returns to default, and a mid-sequence base-image swap) and `test_preview_stage_cache_skips_upstream_recompute` (instruments `apply_pv2012_tone_rgb` with a call counter to directly confirm the tone stage is skipped when only Sharpness changes, and does recompute when Shadows2012 changes) |

| 19 | User asked "should [the point tone curve] be a curve?" — it wasn't: both the widget's rendering and `build_point_curve_lut`'s actual pixel math connected knots with straight line segments (`np.interp`), so the point curve looked and behaved like a polyline rather than the smooth spline every reference tool (Lightroom, Capture One) shows for the same control | N/A (visual/design gap, not a numeric bug) | **Fixed** — switched to `scipy.interpolate.PchipInterpolator` (monotonic piecewise cubic Hermite), not a plain/natural cubic spline: PCHIP is shape-preserving and provably cannot overshoot past the local trend of the input knots, so it can't introduce the ringing/banding artifact a natural spline risks on a steep-then-flat knot layout — the same overshoot failure mode this doc's earlier tone-curve/PV2012 coefficient fixes (#10, #14) were about, just from a different cause (spline math instead of an unsafe linear coefficient). `raw_tone_curve.py` gained `_fit_point_curve` (shared PCHIP fit, deduplicating near-identical x knots since PCHIP requires strictly increasing x) used by both `build_point_curve_lut` (the real 65536-entry LUT) and a new `sample_point_curve_for_display` (a cheap ~96-point sample of the *same* fit, used only for drawing) — so the widget's rendered curve is guaranteed to match what's actually applied to the image, not a separate approximation of it. `tone_curve_widget.py`'s `paintEvent` now draws the sampled spline instead of straight segments between control points. Verified via a headless-Qt screenshot (curve now visibly smooth through the control points) and 2 new smoke tests: `test_point_curve_pchip_no_overshoot` (a steep-rise-then-plateau knot layout stays within `[min(y_i, y_{i+1}), max(y_i, y_{i+1})]` on every segment, catching the exact overshoot a natural spline would produce there) and `test_point_curve_display_matches_applied_lut` (widget-drawn samples match the real LUT to within 0.5/255 at the same x) |

| 20 | User report: "the color noise cannot be removed" — the bilateral filter added in #12 (5-7px kernel diameter) only ever sees noise narrower than itself. Real high-ISO sensor color noise is typically **blotchy**: spatially correlated over several pixels from Bayer demosaic interpolation and sensor readout patterns, not pixel-independent. Confirmed by synthesizing noise with increasing spatial correlation length and measuring the existing bilateral filter's std-dev reduction on each | Pixel-independent noise: 77.4% reduction (bilateral doing its job). Noise blurred with a Gaussian sigma=4 (a representative "blotch" correlation length): only **6.6%** reduction. Sigma=8 (larger blotches): only **1.7%** — the kernel essentially can't see it at all | **Implemented** — added a second, coarser pass in `apply_chroma_denoise`: downsample Cb/Cr (factor 3, 2 in preview), Gaussian-blur at the reduced resolution, upsample back (same principle as JPEG/video 4:2:0 chroma subsampling — human vision resolves color at far lower spatial resolution than luminance, so a softer chroma channel isn't perceptible the way a softer luma channel would be). Blended back with the bilateral (fine) result in proportion to a luma-Sobel-gradient edge mask (`_luma_edge_weight`), so real color edges stay protected while flat/blotchy regions get the much stronger coarse pass. Re-measured with the actual tuned parameters at the strongest reachable slider setting (`strength=1.25`, `ColorNoiseReduction=100`): sigma=4 blotchy noise reduction improved 6.6%→10.9%, sigma=8 improved 1.7%→3.7%, sigma=1.5 (milder, more common) improved 29.5%→37.1%, pixel-independent improved 77.4%→82.9%. Tradeoff: the coarse pass isn't edge-aware on its own, so there is now measurable bleed very close to a hard color edge, bounded by construction (tuned against a synthetic red\|blue edge test) to **~0.04 max channel error at 4px, ~0.004 at 6px, ~0 at 8px+** even at max strength — no user-visible halo beyond a few pixels. Added cost: ~3.7x over the bilateral-only pass at the documented 2000×3000 preview size (63ms → 233ms), but this only matters for slider drags that actually touch `ColorNoiseReduction`/`Temperature`/`Tint`/`Exposure2012` — the `PreviewStageCache` from #18 already skips this stage entirely for any other slider drag (Sharpness, Saturation, PV2012 tone, etc.), and it's still far cheaper than the NLM approach it replaced in #12 (~1100ms+ at a similar size). 2 new smoke tests added: `test_chroma_denoise_removes_blotchy_correlated_noise` (reduction on sigma=4 correlated noise must exceed 8%, guarding against this regressing back toward the ~7% pre-fix baseline) and `test_chroma_denoise_edge_bleed_bounded_near_hard_edge` (bleed at 4/6/8px from a hard edge stays under 0.08/0.03/0.01 respectively at max strength) |

| 21 | User asked to audit and minimize installer size growth since v2.5 (commit `b61fc86`). Diffing `pixi.toml`/`pixi.lock` against that commit showed exactly 4 new top-level packages, no removals: `tifffile` (2.1MB, #13's 16-bit TIFF fix), `pillow-heif` (11MB, unrelated HEIC support added between v2.5 and this work), `lensfunpy` (7.3MB, #F's lens correction), and **`scipy` (77MB)** — by far the largest of the four, and nearly 4x the other three combined. Traced every `scipy` import in the codebase (6 call sites, 5 files) before assuming it was load-bearing everywhere | 4 of the 6 call sites **already had a working non-scipy fallback that was just never exercised**: `raw_tone_recovery.py`'s `_cap_max_edge_linear`/`apply_local_shadow_highlight_recovery_display` had `except ImportError` branches (PIL, or a "skip the feature" warning) that only existed because scipy was never guaranteed present in some earlier era of this codebase; `raw_detail_enhance.py`'s `_gaussian_blur_luma` already tried `cv2.GaussianBlur` *first*, falling back to `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter` only on an exception that never fires (cv2 is unconditionally available) -- the scipy branch was already dead code. `semantic_search.py`'s reverse-geocoder had a real, working brute-force fallback for when `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` isn't available, just implemented as a slow Python `for` loop. Only `raw_tone_curve.py`'s `scipy.interpolate.PchipInterpolator` (added in #19, this session) had no existing alternative | **Fixed — scipy dependency removed entirely.** (1) `raw_tone_recovery.py` (`_cap_max_edge_linear`, `apply_local_shadow_highlight_recovery_display`) and `raw_edit_pipeline.py` (`_tone_map_recovery_display`): `scipy.ndimage.zoom`/`gaussian_filter` replaced with `cv2.resize`/`cv2.GaussianBlur` as the sole path, no fallback branch needed since cv2 is a hard dependency already. Verified numerically against real scipy on synthetic data: `gaussian_filter` vs `cv2.GaussianBlur` differ by ~1e-7 in the interior (border-handling-only difference, confirmed by masking out a 10px edge); **`zoom` vs `cv2.resize` uncovered a real latent bug** in the old code -- `scipy.ndimage.zoom` with a non-integer scale factor zero-bled the last row/column of the upsampled recovery-preview image (confirmed: `zoom(...)[-1,-1]` returned `[0,0,0]` where the source's actual last-pixel value was `[0.327, 0.254, 0.399]`), while `cv2.resize` reproduces the true edge pixel exactly -- so this swap is a correctness fix, not just a dependency removal, for large images going through the recovery-tone-map downsample/upsample path. (2) `raw_detail_enhance.py`: deleted the unreachable scipy fallback branch, cv2 stays the only path (no behavior change, it was dead code). (3) `semantic_search.py`: replaced `cKDTree`-or-Python-loop with a single vectorized numpy nearest-neighbor (`(coords[:,0]-lat)**2 + (coords[:,1]-lon)**2` + `argmin`) -- measured **0.54ms** for a 200k-row synthetic city dataset, no hot loop, so the tree structure was solving a problem numpy already handles fast enough for a once-per-GPS-photo lookup. (4) `raw_tone_curve.py`: **`scipy.interpolate.PchipInterpolator` replaced with a from-scratch pure-numpy monotone cubic Hermite fit** (`_monotone_cubic_fit`, Fritsch-Carlson method) -- the one case with no existing alternative to fall back on. Verified against real scipy across 500+ random knot configurations plus this doc's own steep-then-plateau overshoot test case: max deviation **~1e-15** (float64 noise floor) once the endpoint tangent formula was corrected from a naive secant slope to scipy's actual one-sided 3-point estimator (caught during verification: the naive version diverged from scipy by up to 0.21 on some configurations -- confirmed the *interior* tangents already matched exactly, isolating the bug to the endpoint formula specifically). `pixi install` after removing `scipy` from `pixi.toml` resolves cleanly with no other package requiring it as a transitive dependency. **Net result**: site-packages dropped 635MB → 558MB (**-77MB**), and total growth since v2.5 across all 4 new packages is now ~20.4MB (tifffile 2.1 + pillow-heif 11 + lensfunpy 7.3) instead of ~97.4MB -- an ~79% reduction in this work's net contribution to installer size. 2 new/updated smoke tests: `test_monotone_cubic_fit_matches_scipy_pchip_reference_values` (hand-verified reference values and tangents locked in, since scipy is no longer present in this suite's environment to compare against directly) and the existing point-curve tests (unchanged, now exercising `_monotone_cubic_fit` transparently through `_fit_point_curve`) all still pass |

| 22 | Follow-up: "how about the lite version?" -- checking whether the Lite build profile (`build.py --profile lite`, no AI/semantic search) was affected the same way surfaced a much more serious, currently-shipping bug, found by actually inspecting the built `.app` bundles rather than trusting `pixi.toml`: `dist/RAWviewer.app` and `dist/RAWviewer_Lite.app` (built before this fix) contained **zero cv2 files**. `build.py`'s PyInstaller command line has `--exclude-module cv2` for every macOS build (Full and Lite, unconditional -- not gated by profile), added in a pre-v2.5 commit (`4826883`, "remove unused pyqtgraph and exclude unused modules") when cv2 genuinely was unused. The scene-linear Adjust panel added after v2.5 (`raw_edit_pipeline.py`, `raw_chroma_denoise.py`, `raw_detail_enhance.py`, `raw_hsl.py`, `raw_lens_correction.py`) imports cv2 unconditionally, but nobody updated this exclude when that landed. Separately, Windows Lite's bundled pixi manifest (`_WINDOWS_LITE_PIXI_SKIP`) explicitly stripped `opencv-python-headless` from the Lite install, for the same stale reason (correct when cv2 was AI-search-only, wrong now that it's core). On top of that, `build.py`'s `install_dependencies()` (which populates `rawviewer_env` before a macOS PyInstaller run) never listed `opencv-python-headless`, `tifffile`, or `lensfunpy` at all in its base package list -- confirmed by checking the actual `rawviewer_env` on this machine, which was missing both `tifffile` and `lensfunpy` | Direct, load-bearing evidence, not inference: `find dist/RAWviewer.app -iname "cv2*"` and the Lite equivalent both returned nothing before the fix. This means **opening the Adjust panel in any macOS build (Full or Lite), or using it after a Windows Lite install, would crash with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'`** the instant any control that touches cv2 runs -- Saturation/Vibrance, Chroma/Luma NR, Sharpness/Clarity, Defringe, HSL, and the new lens correction all qualify, so in practice nearly every Adjust panel action. Entirely invisible from this session's dev-mode testing (`pixi run python3 ...` / plain `python3 ...`), since it's a PyInstaller-packaging-only defect | **Fixed and verified with two real, from-scratch PyInstaller builds** (not just a code review): removed `--exclude-module cv2` from the macOS build command, removed `opencv-python-headless` from `_WINDOWS_LITE_PIXI_SKIP`, and added `opencv-python-headless`/`tifffile`/`lensfunpy` to `install_dependencies()`'s base package list (also removing the now-redundant Windows-only `opencv-python-headless` append, folded into the base list). Ran `python3 build.py --profile lite` and `--profile full` end-to-end on this machine: both completed, both bundles were confirmed to actually contain `cv2.abi3.so`, `lensfunpy` (including its full `db_files/` lens-profile database -- checked specifically, since a missing database would make `has_lens_profile()` always return `False` and silently disable the feature) and `tifffile` (verified via `pyi-archive_viewer` since pure-Python modules live inside the compressed `PYZ` archive, not as loose files), and correctly did **not** contain scipy. Both `.app` bundles were then actually launched (`Contents/MacOS/RAWviewer[_Lite]`, backgrounded, killed after 6s) and stayed up through full startup logging with no import crash. Final verified sizes: **`RAWviewer_Lite.app` 242MB, `RAWviewer.app` 250MB** (both up from a stale, incorrectly-built ~157-166MB baseline that was silently missing cv2 the whole time -- not a valid comparison point). Size breakdown of the Lite build's `Frameworks/` shows **cv2 alone is 116MB, by far the single largest component** (more than 2.5x PyQt6's 40MB) -- this is a real, necessary, unavoidable cost of correctly bundling a dependency the app has needed since just after v2.5, not new bloat to trim; `opencv-python-headless` (already the slimmer no-GUI variant) doesn't have a meaningfully smaller equivalent for the cv2 API surface this app actually uses (bilateral/Gaussian filtering, resize/remap, HSV conversion, Sobel, warp). No smoke tests apply here (this is a packaging/build-script fix, not pixel math); verification was the two real builds themselves, which is a stronger check for this class of bug than a unit test would be |

| 23 | User report: "the tone curve update is slow." Benchmarked at the documented 2000x3000 preview size and found the tone curve isn't uniquely slow -- dragging **Contrast2012 alone, no curve at all**, already costs ~567ms/tick through the real `PreviewStageCache` path; the curve only adds ~120ms on top of that. This is the same pre-existing limitation as #18/#3: `PreviewStageCache` can only skip stages that *didn't* change, it can't make the stage that *did* change (WB/denoise/PV2012-tone, for any "upstream" control: Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, tone curve, recovery baseline) cheaper -- that compute is genuinely necessary, not a caching gap. At ~550-700ms/tick, every one of those controls sits far past the 80ms throttle, so the displayed preview visibly lags behind the cursor while dragging | Direct comparison at 2000x3000 via `render_adjust_preview_uint8` + `PreviewStageCache`: Contrast2012 alone ~567ms/tick, Contrast2012+tone-curve ~691ms/tick. Downsampling the same tick's input to a ~1000px-longest-edge copy (`cv2.resize`, `INTER_AREA`) dropped it to ~56ms/tick -- comfortably inside the throttle window, a ~10x reduction | **Implemented** -- a second, independent "fast" edit base + `PreviewStageCache` (`_adjust_preview_base_rgb_fast`, `_adjust_preview_stage_cache_fast`, `_make_fast_preview_base()` in `main.py`), built once per file alongside the existing full-res base (same reset points, no extra invalidation logic needed). `_apply_adjust_panel_preview()` gained a `full_quality` parameter: the one caller that represents continuous/throttled live dragging (`_on_adjust_panel_preview_changed`) stays at the default `full_quality=False` (uses the fast base+cache); every other caller -- initial file load, the "Use recovery look" button, and a new call added to `_on_adjust_panel_editing_finished` that fires once the drag/click gesture settles -- explicitly passes `full_quality=True` (full base+cache), so the displayed image snaps back to full detail the moment the user stops adjusting. The busy/dirty request-coalescing logic already used for throttling (`_adjust_preview_busy`/`_adjust_preview_dirty`) gained a paired `_adjust_preview_dirty_full_quality` flag, OR-combined across queued requests, so a full-quality settle request arriving while a fast tick is still in flight can't get silently downgraded back to fast quality when the queue drains. Verified end-to-end with a tracking stand-in for `_AdjustPreviewWorker`: a live-drag tick is confirmed to use the fast base+cache, a settle request queued behind a busy fast tick is confirmed to still resolve to the full base+cache once that tick finishes, and the real `_make_fast_preview_base` produces a 667x1000 uint16 array from a 2000x3000 uint16 input (dtype preserved, so it flows through the identical `render_adjust_preview_uint8` code path as the full-res base -- no special-casing needed) while leaving already-small images untouched. Re-ran the same 2000x3000 benchmark through the actual production function and confirmed ~55ms/tick for the fast path. Full existing smoke suite re-verified passing (this change touches only `main.py`'s preview-request plumbing, not pipeline math, so `scripts/phase_develop_adjust_linear.py` itself needed no new tests) |

| 24 | User report: toggling Compare on, then moving the tone curve, makes the *original* (left) side of the split view appear to "zoom in". Root cause was a direct regression from #23's fast-preview path, found the same day: `GpuImageView.set_pixmap()` updates `self._img_w`/`_img_h` from whatever pixmap it's just been given, and `_update_compare_overlay()` crops the *original* comparison pixmap using coordinates computed from those same `_img_w`/`_img_h`. While dragging with Compare on, #23's fast/downsampled preview pixmap (e.g. 667x1000) would arrive and shrink `_img_w`/`_img_h` to match it -- but the stored *original* pixmap was still full-resolution (e.g. 2000x3000), so the crop then took only the small fraction of the full-res original that the shrunk coordinates pointed at, stretching that corner across the divider -- exactly the "zoomed in" symptom | Reproduced the mechanism by inspection (not just theory): with a 2000x3000 original and a 667x1000 live pixmap arriving, `split_x = split_frac * _img_w` computes a pixel count sized for the *small* frame (e.g. 333 at a 0.5 split), then `src.copy(0, 0, 333, ...)` crops only the leftmost 333 of the original's 2000 columns -- 16.6% of its true width -- and displays that as if it were half the comparison, i.e. zoomed in | **Fixed** -- `_on_adjust_panel_preview_changed` now checks `gv.is_compare_mode()` and forces `full_quality=True` whenever Compare is active, so the live-drag pixmap is always full-resolution while comparing and `_img_w`/`_img_h` can never diverge from the stored original's actual size. Trades away the #23 speedup specifically for the Compare-mode combination (accepted: Compare is a deliberate "check my work" mode, not continuous editing, and showing a resolution-mismatched comparison would be actively misleading, worse than being temporarily slower). Verified with a tracking stand-in for `_AdjustPreviewWorker`: the same live-drag call now resolves to the full base+cache when `is_compare_mode()` is true and the fast base+cache when it's false, confirming the two states are correctly distinguished |

| 25 | Load / edit-base latency after Fast RAW: (a) `edit_base_decode_params` injects `use_camera_wb=False` + `user_wb` when JPEG-sanity WB correction exists, but `params_supported` rejected that combo → every corrected body fell through to slow rawpy AHD; (b) unpack stash was a single slot so A↔B revisit re-paid LibRaw unpack; (c) edit-base was not reused across reopen Adjust; (d) when `RAWVIEWER_SIDECAR_ADJUST=1`, CURRENT full apply blocked emit for ~1.8–2.1s @45MP with no interim | Code review + synthetic tests (`t_params_supported_user_wb`, `t_unpack_stash_lru`, `t_sidecar_progressive`) | **Implemented (2026-07-16, Mac+Windows)** — (a) `params_supported` accepts valid `user_wb` (unpack already bakes the same correction into `scale_mul`); (b) unpack stash is an LRU (`RAWVIEWER_UNPACK_STASH_SLOTS`, default 3); (c) half-size edit-base LRU (2 slots, mtime/size keyed); (d) `apply_sidecar_progressive`: decode unadjusted → emit preview-capped edited interim → full apply → emit; PRELOAD still skips sidecar. `full_image_cache` remains unadjusted-only. |

| 26 | Follow-up to #23: upstream PV2012 ticks (Contrast/Shadows/Highlights/curve) still lag on the ~1000px fast base once guided-filter y0 smooth + shadow chroma damp run | Same architecture as #23; drag path only | **Implemented (2026-07-16)** — `_ADJUST_FAST_PREVIEW_MAX_EDGE` **1000→640**; live-drag passes `preview_lite=True` into `apply_pv2012_tone_rgb` (skip y0 guided filter + shadow chroma damp). Settle / Compare / export keep the full tone path. Separate fast/full `PreviewStageCache` instances plus `preview_lite` in the tone cache key prevent lite buffers from poisoning settle. Tests: `t_pv2012_preview_lite.py`. |

| 27 | Adjust open: Fit settle (~3514px) → drag sliders paints 640px lite → double-click 100% zooms the soft buffer (`640x427 - 100%` in status). Separately, double-click still queued browse `_queue_sensor_full_decode` while Space already gated it off under Adjust | Last-run `rawviewer_dev.log` on DSC01416.ARW: settle `3514x2344`, then lite spam `640x427`, then `640x427 - 100%` after zoom-in | **Fixed (2026-07-17)** — (1) gate double-click / zoom-to-point browse sensor decode when `_adjust_panel_active()` (match Space); (2) `_should_defer_adjust_preview_paint` skips lite paints while zoomed; (3) `_adjust_hires_render` keeps last ≥1200px settle; `_restore_adjust_hires_before_zoom` puts it back before 100%; (4) zoom-in requests `full_quality=True`. Instant-gain baseline is not replaced by a deferred lite tier. |

Numbers were captured with `raw_edit_pipeline.process_linear_edit_buffer` +
`linear_to_display_uint8` directly (no Qt/GUI thread involved); see the
conversation history or re-run the benchmark snippet against
`scripts/phase_develop_adjust_linear.py`'s helpers for a repeatable check.

## Roadmap investigations (2026-07-04)

Three feasibility investigations, requested as research only (no code changes
in this pass). Each follows Finding → Feasibility → Suggestion.

### A. Lightroom-compatible rating / label system

**Finding.** Ratings exist today (0-5 stars, number keys `0`-`5` in single
view via `rate_current_image()`, `main.py:22779`), but they are
**not written to the file or an XMP sidecar at all**. A rating lives only
inside the `exif_data` blob of the app's local SQLite cache
(`image_cache.py`'s `exif_cache` table — `file_path, file_size, file_mtime,
orientation, camera_make, camera_model, exif_data (BLOB), ...` — no dedicated
`rating` column; it's a key inside the pickled blob, `main.py:22804-22807`
sets `exif_data['rating'] = rating`, `main.py:17069-17073` reads it back).
Rebuilding or deleting that cache silently loses every rating, and ratings
never travel with the file (no round-trip to Lightroom, no round-trip even
to a copy of the file on another machine). There is **no pick/reject flag**
and **no color-label system** anywhere in the codebase — the closest hits are
an unrelated "bookmark for sharing" star icon in the toolbar
(`main.py:7903-7909`) and a "move to Discard subfolder" feature
(`main.py:4839`), neither of which is a metadata flag.

`raw_adjustments.py` already has a working XMP sidecar read/write path
(`write_xmp_adjustments`, `parse_xmp_adjustments`, `resolve_xmp_path`) using
`xml.etree.ElementTree`, but it only ever touches the Camera-Raw-Settings
namespace:
```python
CRS_NS = "http://adobe.com/camera-raw-settings/1.0/"
RDF_NS = "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
X_NS = "adobe:ns:meta/"
```
Lightroom's own rating/label/keyword fields live in namespaces this app
never touches: `xmp:Rating` (`http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/`), `xmp:Label`,
and `dc:subject` (`http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/`) for keywords. Because
the develop-settings parser already reads/writes the same `crs:` namespace
Lightroom itself uses, **this app is already develop-setting-compatible with
Lightroom XMP** (a sidecar written by either app is readable by the other for
tone/color adjustments) — the gap is specifically rating/label/keywords,
which live in namespaces never touched.

One sharp edge: `write_xmp_adjustments` **deletes the whole sidecar file**
when adjustments equal defaults (so an unedited image has no leftover XMP
clutter). If rating/label moved into the same sidecar file, that delete-on-
default logic would need to change first — a photo with 5 stars and no
develop edits would otherwise have its rating silently deleted the moment
adjustments reset to default.

**Feasibility.** Moderate, well-scoped. Three independent pieces:
1. Add `xmp:Rating` (int, -1 to 5, where -1 = rejected per Lightroom
   convention) and `xmp:Label` (string) read/write to the existing
   `ET`-based sidecar code, namespaced separately from `crs:`.
2. Stop treating "adjustments are default" as "delete the sidecar" — instead
   delete only the `crs:` elements/attributes when they reset to default,
   and keep the file (or the `xmp:`/`dc:` elements within it) if a
   rating/label/keyword is still present.
3. Migrate existing SQLite-cached ratings into XMP sidecars once (a one-time
   background pass, non-destructive — cache stays as a fast read-through
   layer, XMP becomes the source of truth), plus point the gallery/filmstrip
   at a star-rating UI (there's currently no rating UI outside single view
   at all — gallery/filmstrip would need one built).

Risk is concentrated in item 2 (sidecar lifecycle change touches a path
several other features now depend on — export's XMP embedding, the gallery
"edited" badge's existence-check) more than in the XMP schema itself, which
is a small, well-documented addition.

**Suggestion.** Do the sidecar-lifecycle change first, in isolation, with a
regression test asserting current develop-settings behavior is unaffected
(reset-to-default still cleans up `crs:` content; a sidecar with only a
rating survives). Then add `xmp:Rating`/`xmp:Label` read/write. Defer the
SQLite-to-XMP migration and any new gallery/filmstrip rating UI to a
follow-up — they're additive and don't block XMP compatibility itself.

---

### B. Aspect / perspective correction, rotation, straighten

**Finding.** The existing rotate button (`main.py:7924-7930`,
`_rotate_current_image_clockwise_persist`) is **90°-step-only** and purely
cosmetic: it applies a `QTransform.rotate(degrees)` to the displayed
`QPixmap` at render time (`_apply_visual_rotation_for_current`,
`main.py:20479-20490`) and persists the chosen angle per-file in `QSettings`
— it never touches RAW pixel data, never writes XMP, and isn't a continuous
angle. A separate, unrelated code path
(`metadata_backend.rotate_exif_orientation_meta_cw90`) rewrites the EXIF
orientation tag for on-disk rotation, again in 90° steps only. There is
**no crop tool, no straighten tool, and no perspective/lens-correction code
anywhere** in the codebase — a full-repo search for
`perspective|straighten|warp|homography|lens correction` returns zero hits.
`DEFAULT_ADJUSTMENTS`/`SLIDER_SPECS` (`raw_adjustments.py`) have no geometry
keys at all, and `write_xmp_adjustments` writes none of Lightroom's
`crs:CropTop/Left/Bottom/Right`, `crs:StraightenAngle`, or
`crs:PerspectiveVertical/Horizontal` fields. This is confirmed as an
intentional gap, not an oversight — the "Not supported" line earlier in this
doc already lists it.

The building blocks for adding this are already present, though: `cv2` is a
real dependency (`raw_chroma_denoise.py`, `raw_detail_enhance.py`,
`raw_hsl.py` all already import it), so `cv2.warpAffine`/
`cv2.warpPerspective`/`cv2.getPerspectiveTransform` are available with zero
new dependencies (`scipy.ndimage` was present at the time this was written
but has since been removed — see Performance review #21 — so `cv2` is the
only, and the more direct, fit now). The display path, `gpu_image_view.py`'s
`GpuImageView`, is a
`QGraphicsView`/`QGraphicsPixmapItem` with an optional `QOpenGLWidget`
*viewport* for GPU-accelerated compositing of an already-CPU-computed
`QPixmap` — **not** a shader/compute pipeline. That distinction matters for
scope: a **straighten** control (continuous-angle rotation, which is affine)
could get a cheap live-preview path via a `QTransform` applied to the scene
item directly, no pixel resampling needed until the user commits. **True
perspective correction is a projective transform**, which `QTransform`-on-a-
pixmap-item cannot represent correctly for anything beyond a coarse preview
— it needs real pixel resampling (`cv2.warpPerspective`) baked into
`raw_edit_pipeline.py`'s scene-linear buffer, both for preview and for
full-resolution export.

**Feasibility.** Substantial — this is a new subsystem, not an extension of
existing sliders, roughly comparable in size to adding the tone-curve UI was.
Concretely it needs: (1) new adjustment keys (`CropTop/Left/Bottom/Right`,
`StraightenAngle`, `PerspectiveVertical/Horizontal`) in
`DEFAULT_ADJUSTMENTS`; (2) a geometry stage in `raw_edit_pipeline.py` that
runs *before* the tone/color stages (crop/rotate/warp changes the buffer's
shape and pixel positions, so everything downstream — denoise, tone,
detail — must operate on the already-geometry-corrected buffer, not the
other way around); (3) `PreviewStageCache` would need a new, earliest
checkpoint for this stage, since a geometry change invalidates literally
everything downstream (the existing 4-stage chain already handles "upstream
change invalidates downstream" — this just adds one more link at the front);
(4) UI: a crop-rectangle overlay with draggable handles and a straighten
slider/dial on the image canvas itself (`gpu_image_view.py`), which is a
different interaction model than any control this app has today (closest
precedent is the WB dropper's click-to-sample mode, `set_color_pick_mode`);
(5) XMP read/write for the new fields; (6) export-path integration so a
baked TIFF/JPEG/WebP actually reflects the crop/straighten/perspective, not
just the preview.

**Suggestion.** Split into two independent phases rather than one project:
- **Phase 1 — straighten + basic rotate/crop.** Affine-only (no
  perspective), which is both the most commonly used of these tools in
  practice and the cheaper build (no projective math, `QTransform` covers
  live preview). This alone would address "rotation" and "straighten" from
  the request.
- **Phase 2 — perspective/aspect correction.** Projective transform, real
  pixel resampling required even for preview, and meaningfully more UI
  complexity (4 independent corner/edge handles or vertical+horizontal
  sliders with a live keystone preview). Worth gating on whether Phase 1
  proves out the geometry-stage architecture (the "runs before
  everything else + gets its own cache checkpoint" design) cleanly first.

---

### C. Mask / brush / gradient local edits

**Finding.** Confirmed: the entire pipeline is global-only today. Every
stage in `raw_edit_pipeline.py` (`process_linear_edit_buffer`,
`_apply_display_stage`) takes the full frame and one flat
`dict[str, float]` of scalar adjustments — there is no mask, region, ROI, or
per-pixel weight concept anywhere in `raw_edit_pipeline.py`,
`raw_adjustments.py`, `raw_pv2012.py`, `raw_hsl.py`,
`raw_detail_enhance.py`, or `raw_chroma_denoise.py`. This doc's own "Not
supported" line already says so. `gpu_image_view.py` is, as in section B,
GPU-accelerated *display* of a CPU-computed bitmap (`QGraphicsView` +
optional `QOpenGLWidget` viewport), not a shader pipeline — there's no cheap
GPU path to evaluate a mask; it would be rasterized and composited on the
CPU like everything else already is.

Two existing precedents are useful building blocks even though neither is a
mask tool: `tone_curve_widget.py`'s `ToneCurveWidget` has a full drag
lifecycle (press → hit-test → drag with live repaint → release commits,
`editing_finished` signal) that's a reasonable template for "drag a handle,
see it live, commit on release" — just on an abstract curve-graph, not image
pixels. `gpu_image_view.py` already does real image-canvas mouse handling
and scene-to-image-pixel coordinate mapping for the WB dropper's
click-to-sample mode (`set_color_pick_mode`/`colorPickRequested`) — the
coordinate-mapping plumbing a brush/gradient tool needs already exists, but
continuous drag-paint stroke accumulation (brush) or two-point gradient
handles (linear/radial gradient) would be new interaction code built on top
of it.

XMP serialization is the deepest structural gap. `write_xmp_adjustments`
writes almost everything as **flat attributes on a single
`rdf:Description`** — one `dict[str, float]` per image, full stop. The one
exception (`ToneCurvePV2012`, a nested `rdf:Seq` of points) proves nested
XML is usable in principle, but there's exactly one such element, not a
repeatable collection. Lightroom's real local-adjustment XMP
(`crs:MaskGroupBasedCorrections`) is an **indexed array of correction
groups**, each with its own nested mask geometry (brush stroke points +
radii, or gradient endpoints) *and* its own scalar adjustment sub-dict.
Supporting this means the in-memory adjustment model — currently one flat
dict, threaded through `process_linear_edit_buffer`, `PreviewStageCache`,
`adjust_panel.py`, and the XMP read/write functions — would need to become
something like `{"global": {...flat dict...}, "local": [{"mask": ...,
"adjustments": {...}}, ...]}`, which touches essentially every call site
that currently assumes "the adjustments are a flat dict."

The recently-added `PreviewStageCache` (Performance review #18) is not
naturally extensible to per-mask recompute — its whole design is "memoize
whole-frame stage outputs keyed by scalar adjustment tuples," and mask
geometry/values have no representation as a scalar key. The pipeline shape
does suggest a workable approach, though: keep the existing global cache
exactly as-is for the base/global look, and treat each local-adjustment
layer as an **additional final compositing stage** — compute a layer's
effect on a (possibly bbox-cropped-to-the-mask) copy of the cached global
output, blend by the mask's alpha, and stack layers in order. This adds cost
roughly proportional to affected pixels/active masks rather than forcing a
full-frame recompute per mask edit, but it's new architecture layered on top
of the existing cache, not a natural extension of it.

**Feasibility.** Large. Rough size comparison: the core pipeline files
(`raw_edit_pipeline.py`, `raw_adjustments.py`, `adjust_panel.py`,
`gpu_image_view.py`, `tone_curve_widget.py`) total ~3,400 lines today. Full
local-adjustment support — mask rasterization engine, brush stroke math,
linear/radial gradient math, a new XMP schema and parser for indexed
correction groups, a per-layer management UI (add/select/delete/reorder
layers, each with its own scalar sliders), and compositing integration into
both the live preview and full-resolution export paths — is plausibly
**1,500-3,000+ new lines**, i.e. on the order of doubling this subsystem
rather than an incremental addition on top of it.

**Suggestion.** This is the largest of the three asks by a wide margin and
has the least existing infrastructure to build on. If pursued, sequence it
as: (1) radial + linear gradient tools first (two-point/two-circle
parametric masks — no rasterized stroke data, no incremental brush storage,
much simpler math and a much smaller XMP footprint: just endpoint
coordinates + feather, not a point cloud) with the "composite as a final
stage on top of the cached global result" architecture; (2) only build the
adjustment brush (arbitrary rasterized mask, incremental stroke
accumulation, by far the most implementation work of the three tools) once
the gradient tools have validated the compositing/XMP-schema approach
end-to-end. Given the size, this likely warrants being scoped and planned as
its own multi-session project rather than a single follow-up task.

### D. Dodge & burn

**Finding.** No existing infrastructure — same zero-mask starting point as
section C (there is no code to build on beyond what C already found).
Classic dodge/burn is functionally a **narrower** special case of a full
adjustment brush, not a separate feature: a single luminance-only intensity
delta (dodge = brighten, burn = darken), applied through an accumulated
grayscale stroke mask, with no color/HSL/detail sliders per stroke the way a
general adjustment brush would need. That narrower scope helps on the
*adjustment* side (one scalar instead of an arbitrary slider set to store
per mask) but does **not** avoid the hard part identified in section C: it
still needs real stroke rasterization and incremental accumulation (repeated
brush passes building up strength, brush hardness/falloff, feathering) —
the same "arbitrary rasterized mask" work section C flagged as the most
expensive of the three tools there, not the gradient tools' cheap parametric
math.

Two things in this codebase are a genuinely good fit for the *adjustment*
side specifically, though: (1) luminance-only math already exists and is
proven — `_luminance()` (`raw_pv2012.py`, `raw_chroma_denoise.py`'s
`_rgb_to_ycbcr`) is exactly the "touch only lightness, preserve hue/chroma"
operation dodge/burn needs, no new color science required; (2) real
dodge/burn tools (Photoshop, Lightroom's Adjustment Brush "Exposure") almost
always protect/target a luminosity range (shadows, midtones, or highlights)
rather than applying a flat delta everywhere a stroke lands, to avoid
blowing out highlights or crushing shadows that are already extreme — and
this exact "smooth region-weight targeting a tonal range" pattern already
exists, twice, in this codebase: `_region_weight_shadows`/
`_region_weight_highlights` in `raw_pv2012.py` and the equivalent
`_region_masks` in `raw_tone_curve.py`, both using the same
`_smooth_weight`/`_SPLIT_SHADOWS` smoothstep shape this doc's monotonicity
fixes (#10, #14) were tuned against. A dodge/burn "range" selector (shadows/
midtones/highlights, matching Photoshop's own tool) could reuse this math
directly instead of inventing new region logic.

The other real design question dodge/burn shares with the general brush: a
rasterized per-pixel stroke mask is a full-resolution single-channel array,
and section C's XMP-schema discussion (moving from a flat scalar dict to
Lightroom's indexed `MaskGroupBasedCorrections`) didn't fully address *how*
such a mask gets serialized. Storing a full-resolution raster as text inside
an XMP sidecar would bloat file sizes considerably; Lightroom's own solution
compresses/encodes mask data compactly within the correction group. This
codebase already has a directly-applicable precedent for "shrink an
auxiliary channel that doesn't need full resolution" — the chroma-denoise
downsample/blur/upsample pass added in Performance review #20 — the same
idea (store the stroke mask at reduced resolution, upsample on the fly) is
a reasonable starting point rather than storing it at full pixel resolution.

**Feasibility.** Same order of magnitude as section C's adjustment brush
(large), because it needs the identical stroke-rasterization/accumulation
architecture — narrowing the adjustment to one luminance scalar plus a
range selector reduces the UI/slider surface area but not the masking
engine work, which is the dominant cost.

**Suggestion.** If a brush tool gets built at all, dodge/burn is the
smallest *useful* version of it — grayscale-only mask, one adjustment
value, one range selector, directly reusing existing luminance and
region-weight code — so it's a reasonable first concrete target for
validating the stroke/mask engine, rather than building a full multi-slider
adjustment brush from the start. This refines, rather than replaces, section
C's suggested order: gradient tools first (cheapest, purely parametric, no
rasterized mask at all), then dodge/burn as the first brush-based tool
(validates stroke rasterization + a compact storage format with the
smallest possible adjustment surface), then the general adjustment brush
once both the mask engine and its storage format are proven.

### E. Trackpad pressure controlling brush intensity

**Finding.** The key enabling fact is already true of this codebase: PyObjC
is a real, actively-used dependency, not just an AppleScript shim.
`pixi.toml`/`pixi.lock` pin `pyobjc-framework-Cocoa` and
`pyobjc-framework-Quartz` (both already resolved in the environment), and
`main.py`'s native file-dialog code (`_create_macos_open_panel`,
`_create_macos_save_panel`) does genuine Objective-C bridging today —
`import objc; objc.lookUpClass("NSOpenPanel")`, `from AppKit import NSURL`,
calling `panel.runModal()` directly — with AppleScript (`osascript` via
`subprocess.run`) only as a fallback when the PyObjC path raises. So the
low-level capability needed here (talking to Cocoa classes directly, not
just shelling out to a script) is proven and already shipping.

Qt itself is not the path in, though. PyQt6's installed bindings do have a
pressure API (`QTabletEvent.pressure()`, `QEventPoint.pressure()` — both
confirmed present in the installed `QtGui.pyi` stubs), but it's designed for
stylus/tablet devices reported by the platform plugin (a Wacom tablet, for
example) — a macOS Force Touch trackpad's "deep press" does not arrive
through `QTabletEvent` at all. Trackpad pressure is a Cocoa-level concept
(`NSEvent.pressure`, `NSPressureConfiguration`, and the
`pressureChangeWithEvent:` `NSResponder` method that fires continuously
during a physical press) that Qt's cross-platform event system doesn't
surface. Confirmed no existing code in this app reads pressure anywhere
today (`gpu_image_view.py`'s and `tone_curve_widget.py`'s mouse handlers use
only `button()`/`buttons()`/`position()`/`modifiers()`).

An important hardware/API limitation, independent of implementation effort:
continuous pressure is **only** available on Force Touch trackpads (all
modern MacBook trackpads, Magic Trackpad 2) with the responder opted into
continuous reporting — a plain click, an external mouse, a Magic Mouse, an
older Magic Trackpad 1, and every non-macOS platform report no continuous
pressure signal at all, only a binary click. Any pressure-driven intensity
control therefore cannot be the *only* way to set brush intensity; it has
to be an optional modulation on top of a baseline control (a slider, a
fixed per-stroke opacity, or drag-speed) that works everywhere else.

**Feasibility.** Good for the native-bridge part specifically (this
codebase already proves PyObjC/Cocoa integration works here, for a
different but analogous purpose), but this is a small, platform-specific
addition on top of whatever brush/dodge-burn tool exists — not something to
build before there's a brush to modulate. Concretely it needs: a custom
`NSView`/`NSResponder` override (likely reachable by wrapping the native
view underneath `GpuImageView`'s window via PyObjC, similar in spirit to how
the save/open panel code already reaches into AppKit) overriding
`pressureChangeWithEvent:`, forwarding the continuous pressure float into
Qt (macOS integrates the Cocoa run loop with Qt's event loop on the main
thread, so this shouldn't need complex cross-thread marshaling, but that
needs to be verified in practice, not assumed), and a fallback path (no-op,
or a fixed default intensity) for every device/platform that can't supply
pressure.

**Suggestion.** Treat this strictly as a follow-on refinement, scoped and
built only after a baseline (non-pressure-sensitive) brush/dodge-burn tool
exists and ships — bundling "build the local-adjustment masking engine" and
"also get low-level Cocoa pressure events flowing into Qt" into one project
multiplies risk (two largely-unrelated hard problems) for a payoff (pressure
modulation) that's meaningless without the brush already working. When it
is picked up, prototype the Cocoa bridge in isolation first (e.g. log
pressure values to the console while dragging on a Force Touch trackpad)
before wiring it into any real intensity control, to validate the
main-thread event-forwarding assumption above cheaply.

### F. Lens profile automatic aspect/distortion correction — Implemented (2026-07-05)

Originally scoped out here as low-feasibility because no lens-calibration
database existed in the project (`lensfun`/`lensfunpy` unvendored). Re-scoped
and implemented after further research corrected two things: (1) `lensfunpy`
ships **prebuilt wheels bundling the lensfun C library and its full lens
database** for Linux/macOS/Windows (948 cameras / 1304 lenses out of the box,
confirmed by loading `lensfunpy.Database()` directly) — not a from-source
build as first assumed; (2) the lens database itself is CC BY-SA 3.0 (the C
library is LGPLv3, fine to link from closed-source code) — a real license
term to be aware of when bundling, but not a blocker. See the "Lens profile
correction" section below for the implementation. Geometric distortion only
(the "aspect correction" originally asked about) — vignetting/TCA correction
(lensfunpy supports both) are not wired up, a possible future extension.

### G. Per-channel R/G/B tone curves

**Finding.** Deferred (2026-07-05): user asked to keep the single RGB tone
curve for now rather than add separate R/G/B channel curves. Worth
recording why this isn't a small variation on the existing curve, for
whoever picks it up later.

The current point tone curve and all PV2012 sliders are deliberately
**hue-preserving**: `apply_pv2012_tone_rgb` computes one scalar ratio per
pixel from luminance alone and multiplies all three channels by that same
ratio (`out = img * ratio[..., newaxis]`) — this is exactly what keeps tone
edits from shifting color, and was the property this doc's PV2012 bug hunts
(#9, #10, #16) were protecting.

A per-channel curve (`R' = curveR(R)`, `G' = curveG(G)`, `B' = curveB(B)`
applied independently) is a fundamentally different operation: once the
three curves diverge, the ratio *between* channels changes per-pixel in a
curve-shaped way, which does shift hue/saturation — usually on purpose
(this is how "teal shadows, orange highlights" film-look grades are built).
It sits between what the existing tone curve does and what HSL
(`raw_hsl.py`) does: HSL shifts hue/saturation directly in HSV space for
8 selected hue bands; a per-channel curve shifts hue/saturation as a
side-effect of independent per-channel tone shaping. Different mechanism,
different creative purpose, not a superset/subset of either existing tool.

**Feasibility.** Moderate-to-large, not because the curve math is hard —
the PCHIP fitting machinery already built (`_monotone_cubic_fit`,
`sample_point_curve_for_display` in `raw_tone_curve.py`) is generic over
any point list and directly reusable per channel with no new correctness
risk — but because of everything around it: (1) where it composes in the
pipeline (before or after the existing hue-preserving ratio stage — after,
as a final grade on top of tone-corrected output, is the sane choice, but
that's a new stage at a specific point, not a reused slot); (2) UI — 3 more
curve graphs or a channel-switcher on the existing widget (color-coded
R/G/B tabs); (3) XMP — 3 new point-array fields (Lightroom's own schema has
separate `ToneCurveRed`/`Green`/`Blue` sequences alongside the master
curve, so the shape is known, just needs replicating ×3, not invented from
scratch).

**Suggestion.** If picked up later: reuse `_monotone_cubic_fit`/
`sample_point_curve_for_display` as-is per channel (no new math), compose
the per-channel stage *after* the existing hue-preserving ratio (so it
reads as an intentional grading step on top of corrected tone, not tangled
into the ratio math itself), and mirror Lightroom's `ToneCurveRed`/`Green`/
`Blue` XMP field naming for compatibility with sidecars written by either
app. Scope this as its own task — it touches pipeline placement, UI, and
XMP simultaneously, so it doesn't fit as a quick add-on to the existing
curve.
