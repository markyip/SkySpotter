"""Regression guard: switching to gallery view must close an open editor.

Original bugs (reported back-to-back from a real run): (1) after editing
an image and returning to the gallery, the Adjust panel stayed visible,
splitting the window between gallery (upper half) and the still-open
editor (lower half), because _show_gallery_view only ever hid
single_view_container -- never single_image_adjust_panel, so the splitter
just gave the panel the space the image view gave up. (2) that also left
_adjust_overlay_visible stuck True, so the *next* gallery -> single-image
click silently behaved as if still editing and failed to render.

First fix attempt gated the close on self._adjust_panel_active(), which
checks `self.view_mode == "single"`. That looked right in isolation, but
EVERY real caller of _show_gallery_view() (toggle_view_mode,
_switch_to_gallery_for_search, _on_view_mode_button_clicked's burst-view
branch) sets `self.view_mode = "gallery"` BEFORE calling
_show_gallery_view() -- so by the time the check ran, view_mode was
already "gallery" and _adjust_panel_active() always returned False,
silently no-op'ing the whole fix. The bug kept recurring in real use
because the first regression test here mocked view_mode="single" at
check-time, which doesn't match the real call order and so didn't catch
it. The real fix checks _adjust_overlay_visible/panel.isVisible()
directly, without gating on the (already-changed) view_mode.

_show_gallery_view touches enough unrelated machinery (gallery widgets,
image manager, filmstrip, title bar) that mocking a full call is too
fragile to be a reliable regression guard; this checks the fix via source
inspection, but specifically replicates the real call order this time
(view_mode already "gallery" at the point the check would run).
