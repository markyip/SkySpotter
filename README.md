## ✈️ Why This Exists
You're an aviation photographer who just returned from RIAT or spent a day at the Mach Loop. You took thousands of RAW shots of fast jets, helicopters, and flybys — and now you're facing the real challenge:

- You want to **sort through all your photos** and identify the best shots.
- Tools like **Lightroom** or **Capture One** are powerful, but importing and checking each image is **time-consuming**.
- The default **Windows Photos** viewer lets you browse, but:
  - It's clunky with RAW files.
  - You have to zoom in manually to check sharpness.
  - There's no easy way to filter out blurry images.

I've been there myself — I still haven't finished editing my **500GB of RIAT 2024 photos** because of how tedious this process is. That frustration is exactly what inspired me to build **SkySpotter**.

SkySpotter is a lightweight, focused image viewer built specifically for photographers who shoot a lot — especially in aviation, wildlife, or sports.

- Instant file previewing: No import steps — just drag & drop.
- Zoom in with a single key to check sharpness immediately.
- Stay in zoomed mode while browsing with arrow keys.
- Quickly remove blurry photos from the queue with `↓` (moves them to a discard folder).
- No complex controls to memorize — just the essential keys to move fast.

This is a **pre-filtering tool**, letting you go through hundreds of RAW files efficiently **before** committing to editing them in Lightroom or Photoshop.

## 🔍 What is SkySpotter?
**SkySpotter** is a fast, modern, cross-platform image viewer for Windows and macOS, built with PyQt6. It supports advanced zooming, panning, and direct file association, allowing RAW files to be opened with a double-click.

## ✨ Features

- **Non-destructive visual rotate**: Rotate in viewer by 90° steps without modifying original files (including RAW), with gallery-visible tiles refreshed immediately.
- **Precision Focus Area Detection**: Overlays the camera's focus point(s) using manufacturer-specific MakerNote data (Canon, Nikon, Sony) plus EXIF SubjectArea/SubjectLocation with orientation-aware mapping and robust coordinate scaling.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Download Executable

#### Windows
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/markyip/SkySpotter/releases/latest)
2. Download `SkySpotter.exe` directly (no zip extraction needed)
3. Double-click `SkySpotter.exe` to launch
4. **Optional**: Create a desktop shortcut or pin to taskbar

#### macOS
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/markyip/SkySpotter/releases/latest)
2. Download and extract `SkySpotter-v2.0.1-macOS.zip`
3. Drag `SkySpotter.app` to your **Applications** folder.
4. **CRITICAL FIRST STEP:** Because this is an open-source app not signed via the paid Apple Developer program, macOS Gatekeeper will incorrectly label it as "Damaged" or block it. **You must run this command in your Terminal once** to remove the download quarantine flag:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/SkySpotter.app
   ```
5. You can now double-click to launch it normally from Applications or Launchpad!

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Space**: Toggle between fit-to-window and 100% zoom
- **`G`**: Toggle between Gallery View and Single Image View
- **`Esc`**: Return to Gallery View (from Single View)
- **`←`/`→` arrows**: Navigate between images
- **`↓`**: Move current image to Discard folder
- **Delete**: Delete current image (with confirmation)
- **`H`**: Show or hide the single-image histogram strip
- **`F`**: Toggle dashed focus/subject indicator overlay (amber = maker AF, lime = EXIF subject area)

## 🔎 Gallery search (Gallery view)

Open the bottom search panel. The search field placeholder is **Search gallery**.

- On **macOS** with bundled Core ML models, free-text queries run **semantic ranking** over the images that pass any filters below.
- **Important:** Words like **`face`**, **`faces`**, **`people`**, **`person`**, and **`human`** are **not** sent to the neural search: they filter by the **Vision face-detection count** stored at index time (same as `has:face`). If no faces were detected (distant subjects, backs to camera, silhouettes), those photos are excluded—try free-text phrases instead, e.g. `crowd`, `pedestrians`, `spectators`.
- **Formats:** Prefer **`format:jpeg`** · **`format:raw`** (`type jpeg` / `ext raw` with a space also normalize). Loose phrases **`file jpeg`** / **`file raw`** map to **`format:`** so **`.jpg`** matches **JPEG** synonyms and **`raw`** covers typical camera RAW extensions (not only filenames containing the substring `raw`).
- You can combine a description with structured filters on one line (see examples).
- **Clear** the field or use the **×** control to restore the full folder.

### Gallery search syntax examples

Separate tokens with spaces. Filters use `key:value` or comparison forms.

| Kind | Example |
|------|---------|
| Free text + filter | `jet takeoff camera:sony iso<800` |
| Camera / lens | `camera:canon` · `lens:70-200` |
| ISO / year | `iso<=800` · `year>=2024` |
| Place | `city:tokyo` · `country:jp` · `admin:california` |
| File name | `filename:_dsc` or `name:img_` |
| File format | `format:cr3` · `type:jpeg` · `ext:jpg,png` · `format:raw` (same set as [`src/raw_file_extensions.py`](src/raw_file_extensions.py)) |
| Date prefix | `date:2024-05` |
| GPS / faces | `has:gps` · `no:gps` · `has:face` · `people` · `person` · `no:face` |

Optional: **stronger semantic models** (advanced). The app bundle uses **MobileCLIP2-S0** for speed and size. From the same MobileCLIP2 family, **S2** or **B** checkpoints usually score better on open-vocabulary retrieval at the cost of a larger Core ML package and slower indexing—export with `python scripts/export_mobileclip2_coreml.py --model MobileCLIP2-S2` (today’s `--for-app` flow names files `mobileclip2_s0_*`; you can replace those mlpackages after export or adjust filenames to match). You can also set environment variable **`SKYSPOTTER_MOBILECLIP_VARIANT=s2`** to prefer Apple’s downloadable **MobileCLIP S2** Core ML models (a different architecture than MobileCLIP2, but often strong for general photo text queries).

Bundled macOS Core ML models are discovered automatically in common app/resource paths.  
Both naming schemes are supported:

- Apple Hub naming: `mobileclip_s2_image.mlpackage` + `mobileclip_s2_text.mlpackage`
- App export naming (`--for-app`): `mobileclip2_s0_image.mlpackage` + `mobileclip2_s0_text.mlpackage`

## 🖱️ Mouse Controls

- **Double-click**: Zoom in to the clicked point (from fit), or zoom out to fit
- **Pinch (Mac/Windows Trackpad) or Ctrl+Scroll**: Smoothly zoom in/out with smart cursor anchoring
- **Click and drag**: Pan image when zoomed in
- **Drag and drop**: Open images or folders

## 🧠 Training a Custom Image Classifier (e.g., Bird Watching, Cars)

SkySpotter is equipped with scripts that make it incredibly easy to train a custom image classifier on your own datasets (e.g., classifying bird species instead of aircraft).

1. **Organize Your Data**: Create a folder (e.g., `./CustomDataSet`) and inside it, create a subfolder for each class (e.g., `./CustomDataSet/Eagle/`, `./CustomDataSet/Sparrow/`). Place your training images inside their respective subfolders.
2. **Background Removal (Highly Recommended)**: Training your model on images with backgrounds removed forces the model to learn the true shape of the subject rather than background context (e.g., blue skies vs. trees). You can use our `scripts/batch_bg_pipeline.py` to strip the backgrounds and tightly crop your images before training.
3. **Train the Model**: Open `scripts/train_aviation_specialist.py` (or duplicate it) and modify the `DATA_PATH` to point to your new dataset folder. Then run it:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_aviation_specialist.py
   ```
4. **Export to ONNX**: The training script will output a PyTorch model directory. Open `scripts/export_to_onnx.py`, point `CHECKPOINT_DIR` to your newly trained model directory, and set `ONNX_OUTPUT` to your desired save location. Run it:
   ```bash
   python scripts/export_to_onnx.py
   ```
   *You can then replace the default `.onnx` model in the `src/models/` folder with your newly trained model!*

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Windows
- **"Windows protected your PC"**: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
- **Antivirus warnings**: Add SkySpotter to your antivirus exclusions
- **Performance issues**: Try running as administrator
- **AttributeError with stdout**: This is normal for windowed builds - the application runs without a console window

### macOS
- **"App is damaged and should be moved to the Trash" / "Apple could not verify SkySpotter is free of malware"**: 
  - **Why it happens**: Apple heavily restricts apps downloaded outside the App Store that aren't signed with a paid developer certificate. On newer macOS versions (especially Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3), macOS breaks the app's ad-hoc signature and aggressively blocks opening it.
  - **The Fix (Fastest)**: Open your **Terminal** app and run the following command to remove the quarantine flag:
    ```bash
    xattr -cr /Applications/SkySpotter.app
    ```
    *(Note: If you placed the app somewhere other than the Applications folder, update the path accordingly).*

- **"Symbol not found: (_mkfifoat)" or App crashes instantly on macOS 12 (Monterey) or older**:
  - **Why it happens**: The pre-built release is compiled using a newer macOS 13+ SDK. Older macOS versions do not have the required system files to run it.
  - **The Fix**: You must build the app locally (see the "Ultimate Fix" below).

#### 🛠️ The Ultimate Fix: Build Locally (Solves Both Issues Above)
If you are on macOS 12 or older, OR if you simply want to permanently bypass all Gatekeeper/Quarantine warnings forever, you can build the app directly on your own machine. It takes about 2 minutes:
1. **Install Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12** (We recommend the official installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)).
2. **Open Terminal** and run these commands to download and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/markyip/SkySpotter.git
   cd SkySpotter
   ./build_macos.sh
   ```
This will automatically create a perfectly compatible, warning-free `SkySpotter.app` inside the `dist/` folder!

#### 🔧 Local Build Troubleshooting
- **Error: "No matching distribution found for pyexiv2"**
  - **Why it happens**: You are using an older version of Python (like macOS Monterey's default Python 3.9) on an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac. `pyexiv2` does not provide pre-compiled packages for that specific combination.
  - **The Fix**: 
    1. Install a newer version of Python (e.g., Python 3.11).
    2. **CRITICAL:** If you previously ran the build script, it created a virtual environment stuck on the old Python version. Delete it by running `rm -rf skyspotter_env`.
    3. Re-run `./build_macos.sh` (If it still uses 3.9, explicitly point to your new Python, e.g., `/usr/local/bin/python3 ./build_macos.sh`).

- **Error: Massive C++ compilation failures / PyQt6 missing wheels**
  - **Why it happens**: You are using a bleeding-edge version of Python (like Python 3.14). It takes the open-source community several months to build pre-compiled packages for brand-new Python versions. Without a wheel, the installer attempts to compile massive UI frameworks like PyQt6 from raw C++ source code, which usually fails.
  - **The Fix**: Roll back to a widely supported "sweet spot" version like **Python 3.11** or **3.12**, where every single required library has highly stable, pre-compiled macOS packages ready to download instantly. Remember to delete your old `skyspotter_env` folder before rebuilding!

- **Homebrew delays on macOS 12 Monterey or older**: 
  - Homebrew has officially dropped "binary bottle" support for Monterey. However, **it still works**. When the build script attempts to `brew install inih gettext`, Homebrew will simply compile them from source on your machine. This is completely normal but may take 2-3 extra minutes.

- **Permission Denied / Cannot Read Folder**: Modern macOS requires explicit permission for apps to access the Desktop or Documents. 
  1. Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Full Disk Access**.
  2. Click the **+** button and add `SkySpotter.app`.
  3. Toggle it to **ON**.

- **"Semantic search unavailable" / asks to download models even in packaged app**:
  1. Open `SkySpotter.app/Contents/Resources/models/mobileclip2_coreml/`.
  2. Confirm either **S2** pair (`mobileclip_s2_*`) or **S0 app-export** pair (`mobileclip2_s0_*`) exists, plus `bpe_simple_vocab_16e6.txt.gz`.
  3. If missing, rebuild with `models/mobileclip2_coreml/` present before running `python build.py`.
